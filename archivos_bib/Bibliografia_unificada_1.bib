  abstract = {The AI-controlled Smart IoT-based Greenhouse Monitoring System represents a cutting-edge solution for precision agriculture. Leveraging the power of Artificial Intelligence and the Internet of Things, this system continuously monitors and optimizes environmental variables within the greenhouse, including temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and light levels. Greenhouse gases are the gases in the atmosphere that raise the surface temperature of Earth. Water vapor (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and Ozone (O3) are some of the examples for greenhouse gases. This article provides an overview of such an automation workflow in greenhouse environments by means of distributed wireless nodes. It makes use of both the IoT and AI technique. Predictions are made through the AI technique which makes use of CNN approach. After a comparative study, sample results from commercial and research greenhouse experiments with the IoT hardware and software have been provided to show connection stability, robustness, and reliability.},

  abstract = {Municipal solid waste is one of the most significant sources of gas emissions. In a context of renewable energy production and greenhouse gas emission reduction, we focus on the amount of biogas produced by the anaerobic digestion of organic matter in a controlled landfill environment. We present a mathematical model describing this process from a microbiological and biochemical point of view, including the dynamics of the methane and carbon dioxide produced. A qualitative analysis of the dynamic system shows the existence of an infinite number of non-hyperbolic equilibria inducing an attractor that has been identified. Through numerical tests, we explore how the non-connectivity of the attractor resulting from the choice of growth functions can entirely transform the performance of the process, and highlight critical initial stock values that influence the amount of biogas produced.},

  abstract = {The increase in solid waste generation is caused primarily by the global population growth that resulted in urban sprawl, economic development, and consumerism. Poor waste management has adverse impacts on the environment and human health. The recent years have seen increasing interest in using black soldier fly (BSF), Hermetia illucens, as an organic waste converter. Black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) feed voraciously on various types of organic waste, including food wastes, agro-industrial by-products, and chicken and dairy manure, and reduce the initial weight of the organic waste by about 50\% in a shorter period than conventional composting. The main components of the BSFL system are the larvero, where the larvae feed and grow, and the fly house, where the adults BSF live and reproduce. It is essential to have a rearing facility that maintains the healthy adult and larval BSF to provide a sufficient and continuous supply of offspring for organic waste treatment. The BSF organic waste processing facility consists of waste pre-processing, BSFL biowaste treatment, the separation of BSFL from the process residue, and larvae and residue refinement into marketable products. BSFL digest the nutrients in the wastes and convert them into beneficial proteins and fats used to produce animal feed, and BSFL residue can be used as an organic fertilizer. This review summarizes the BSFL treatment process to provide an in-depth understanding of the value of its by-products as animal feed and organic fertilizer.},

  abstract = {Black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) can utilize food by-products or residues for growth, benefiting farm animal’s diets’ production sustainability. The experiment aimed to assess the effect of different substrate compositions on larval growth, chemical composition, and substrate temperature. BSFL were allocated to one of the four diets (control, vegetable, carnivorous, and omnivorous) for the entire experiment (8 days). The temperature was measured twice daily using a thermal-imaging camera, and the accumulated degree hours (ADH) was calculated. The results showed that the larvae fed the vegetable diet exhibited a significantly reduced growth performance, with a biomass reduction of 26.3\% compared to the control diet; furthermore, vegetable-fed larvae showed a lower dry matter content (−30\% compared to the average of other diets) due to lower fat content (−65\% compared to average of other diets). The nutritional composition of larvae fed an omnivorous diet was similar to larvae fed a high-quality substrate diet (control diet-chicken feed), indicating that the omnivorous diet could be an ideal solution for rearing BSFL larvae; however, the current European legislation prohibits the use of animal meal. The study also revealed that substrate temperatures did not have a discernible influence on larval growth, further emphasizing the importance of diet in BSFL rearing strategies.},

A bibliometric and bibliographic review was conducted to elucidate the pivotal role played by the bioconversion of organic matter in shaping sustainable circular economy systems. The analysis revealed that black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) have proven effective in the bioconversion of common waste, such as household and livestock waste, yielding valuable biomass. Despite these advancements, the exploration of new sources of organic matter persists to mitigate its environmental impact. Emerging technologies enable the efficient processing of BSFL biomass, yielding substitutes for environmentally unfriendly materials. Although the literature emphasizes the advantages of BSF in constructing circular economy models, obstacles such as limited legislation and insufficient incentives for producers, concerns about pathogens and contaminants, and low public acceptance of this species are identified. However, the growing trend in scientific interest suggests that BSF could play a central role in building sustainable societies in the future.},

  abstract = {The transition from a linear to a circular production system involves transforming waste into valuable resources. Insect-mediated bioconversion, particularly using black soldier fly (BSF) larvae, can offer a promising opportunity to convert the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) into protein-rich biomass. However, current regulatory restrictions do not allow the use of this substrate to obtain insect proteins for animal feed, prompting the exploration of other applications, such as the production of bioplastics. Here, we explored at laboratory scale an innovative and integrated circular supply chain which aims to valorize the OFMSW through BSF larvae for the production of biobased materials with high technological value. BSF larvae reared on this organic waste showed excellent growth performance and bioconversion rate of the substrate. The use of well-suited extraction methods allowed the isolation of high-purity lipids, proteins, and chitin fractions, which are building blocks to produce biobased materials. In particular, the protein fraction was used to develop biodegradable plastic films which showed potential for replacing traditional petroleum-based materials, with the possibility to be fully recycled back to amino acids. Socioeconomic analysis highlighted values generated along the entire supply chain, and life cycle assessment pointed out that lipid extraction was the most challenging step: implementation of more sustainable methods is thus needed to reduce the overall environmental impact of the proposed chain. In conclusion, this study represents a proof of concept gathering evidence to support the feasibility of an alternative supply chain that can promote circular economy while valorising organic waste.},

  abstract = {A traceability system can quickly and accurately query product supply chain circulation information. It is difficult to obtain processing information and achieve sharing due to the big data, long duration, large amount of equipment and scattered and easily lost processing information. In tracing the application of the case-based reasoning (CBR) to product processing, we can solve the problem of establishing an accurate and complete mathematical model between the processing information and product quality defects by finding a target record in a large amount of historical data. The traceability model of ontology and CBR uses the web ontology language (OWL) for case representation to simplify the CBR framework for big data, classifies process data and standardizes information storage. A joint optimization algorithm based on the genetic algorithm (GA) and CBR is proposed to establish an optimization model of process traceability, which is applied to case retrieval and reuse. This algorithm optimizes the genetic operator by combining the optimal preservation strategy and roulette selection method and uses an exponential-scale transformation method to stretch the fitness function. The experiments show that the optimized traceability model can infer information from garbled codes, wrong codes and missing messages to quickly determine the problematic products, thus effectively improving the traceability accuracy of product processing.},

Quality of life, the green economy, and pollution management in society require comprehensive environmental monitoring systems with easy-to-use features and maintenance. This research suggests implementing a wireless sensor network with embedded sensor nodes manufactured using the Selective Surface Activation Induced by Laser technology. Such technology allows the integration of electrical circuits with free-form plastic sensor housing. In this work, a low-cost asynchronous web server for monitoring temperature and humidity sensors connected to the ESP32 Wi-Fi module has been developed. Data from sensor nodes across the facility are collected and displayed in real-time charts on a web server. Multiple web clients on the same network can access the sensor data. The energy to the sensor nodes could be powered by harvesting energy from surrounding sources of electromagnetic radiation. This automated and self-powered system monitors environmental and climatic factors, helps with timely action, and benefits sensor design by allowing antenna and rf-circuit formation on various plastics, even on the body of the device itself. It also provides greater flexibility in hardware modification and rapid large-scale deployment.},

  abstract = {Fly larvae composting is an emerging waste treatment alternative with great potential to increase revenue from food waste management. For wider implementation, fly larvae composting has to be evaluated in comparison with conventional systems, based on direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emission data for the treatment process, which are currently limited. This study evaluated direct emissions of CO2, CH4, N2O and NH3 from composting of food waste using black soldier fly (BSF) larvae (Hermetia illucens). Use of BSF larvae-associated bacteria in 7-day pre-treatment and seeding at larvae treatment start were evaluated and compared to larvae treatment without bacteria addition. The treatments were performed in a set of 14-day laboratory-scale experiments. Mean substrate reduction was 49 ± 8\% and bioconversion ratio was 24 ± 8\% (both dry matter basis). Direct GHG emissions from the fly larvae treatment process were generally very small, with emissions of CH4 and N2O equivalent to 0.38 kg CO2-equivalents per ton food waste treated assuming global warming potential over 100 years, while mean total CO2 emissions were 96 g CO2 per kg food waste treated. Additional emissions could be expected to occur in the pre-treatment process, which did not provide any significant improvement in bioconversion ratio or reduction in total GHG emissions during treatment. Similarly, use of BSF larvae-associated bacteria did not significantly improve process efficiency. No NH3 emissions were detected, as reflected in total N mass balance over the treatment cycle. The results show that total direct GHG emissions from food waste treatment by fly larvae composting are lower than those from conventional food waste treatment, and that pre-treatment and seeding of food waste with BSF larvae-associated bacteria do not further reduce total GHG emissions.},

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of the larvae in reducing and converting mixtures of fresh food waste (FW) with other organic waste types, i.e., immature windrow composting material (IW), residue windrow composting material (RW), and fresh cow manure (CM) at three different composition ratios. The growth rate and protein content of the larvae were also determined in this study. A specific amount of organic waste mixtures was fed to the BSF larvae. The results suggest that the type of organic waste given to larvae affected the overall waste reduction and larval growth at a certain extent. The composition ratio of FW with the other wastes used was 90:10, 70:30, and 60:40 (w/w). The highest reduction percentage was at the ratio of 90:10 achieved for FW mixed with IW, FW mixed with RW, and FW mixed with CM, i.e. 82.2\%, 79\%, and 74.5\% respectively. The protein content of larvae in those waste mixtures was 54.6\%, 63.1\%, and 48.75\% respectively. The final residue from the decomposition of the waste by BSF larvae was also observed in this study.}

The climatic condition is believed to be biannual dry seasons which is very difficult for farmers to cultivate crops due to shortage of water and poor soil fertility. Yet heavy rainfall is still a great threat for the farmers since it devastates cash crops. The use of a smart greenhouse with Artificial Intelligence to grow and protect plants in both dry and wet seasons and reduce labor-intensive human tasks and automate pervasive data analytics of daily plant status can surprisingly boost food security. Here we present a fully automated greenhouse system with artificial intelligence embedded in it that uses around 10,000 plant images in it that initially nurtureplants under optimum atmospheric conditions by taking real-time decisions, detectingany kind of illness, and interestingly notifyingthe stage of fruit ripeness. By implementing a neural network-based computer vision approach we were able to keep track of the health status of the plants caused by several microorganisms. The obtained predictions and results accurately verify how machine learning can be used to increase gross national food security by implementing such systems in multiple farming areas without prior human involvement.},

  abstract = {Climate change is defined as the shift in climate patterns mainly caused by greenhouse gas emissions from natural systems and human activities. So far, anthropogenic activities have caused about 1.0~°C of global warming above the pre-industrial level and this is likely to reach 1.5~°C between 2030 and 2052 if the current emission rates persist. In 2018, the world encountered 315 cases of natural disasters which are mainly related to the climate. Approximately 68.5 million people were affected, and economic losses amounted to \$131.7 billion, of which storms, floods, wildfires and droughts accounted for approximately 93\%. Economic losses attributed to wildfires in 2018 alone are almost equal to the collective losses from wildfires incurred over the past decade, which is quite alarming. Furthermore, food, water, health, ecosystem, human habitat and infrastructure have been identified as the most vulnerable sectors under climate attack. In 2015, the Paris agreement was introduced with the main objective of limiting global temperature increase to 2~°C by 2100 and pursuing efforts to limit the increase to 1.5~°C. This article reviews the main strategies for climate change abatement, namely conventional mitigation, negative emissions and radiative forcing geoengineering. Conventional mitigation technologies focus on reducing fossil-based CO2 emissions. Negative emissions technologies are aiming to capture and sequester atmospheric carbon to~reduce carbon dioxide levels. Finally, geoengineering techniques of radiative forcing alter the earth’s radiative energy budget to stabilize or reduce global temperatures. It is evident that conventional mitigation efforts alone are not sufficient to meet the targets stipulated by the Paris agreement; therefore, the utilization of alternative routes appears inevitable. While various technologies presented may still be at an early stage of development, biogenic-based sequestration techniques are to a certain extent mature and can be deployed immediately.},

In this study, weight gain data from BSF larvae fed diets with distinct nutrient compositions were used to build a machine learning model. Among the algorithms tested, the XGBoost model demonstrated the best performance in predicting weight gain. The model identified protein as the most critical nutrient factor for larval biomass and was used to determine the optimal diet by calculating the highest weight gain from 30,000 randomly generated nutrient combinations. Supplementing the missing nutrients in organic waste according to the optimal diet improved the weight gain and feed conversion rate of BSF larvae. Feeding larvae a mixture of organic wastes, a costeffective strategy to meet dietary nutrition requirements, resulted in significant increases in both the bioconversion rate (up to 9.7\%) and mass reduction rate (up to 22.8\%) of organic waste.},

The results highlight that the carbon footprint associated with fresh larva production is approximately thirty times lower than that of conventional animal farming, aligning with sustainable practices and offering a promising alternative in the quest for eco-friendly protein sources. Moreover, the water footprint of the black soldier fly farm is significantly lower than that of traditional animal farms, underscoring the environmental advantages of this innovative approach to larva production over conventional livestock farming.

The aims of this research were two-fold: (1) validate an existing closed rearing system design; and (2) assess whether a microbial inoculum derived from the rearing residue increases rearing performance. In controlled bench-scale experiments, BSFL were reared on tomato pomace (TP) and white wine pomace (WWP), along with food waste as control substrate. The two aims were assessed based on the following response variables: larval mass, substrate reduction, residue properties (i.e. pH, temperature, moisture content), and larval intestinal and residue microbiota. Higher BSFL mass (by 5.1 mg dry mass) at harvest on WWP and substrate reduction on TP (by 11.7\% dry mass) in the closed system compared to the open system confirmed the potential of closed systems for rearing performance improvements of agri-food by-products. The rearing system also affected the residual moisture content and temperature, but only had a small effect on microbiota. Performance improvements by the closed rearing system design may be outweighed by insufficient aeration with pasty substrates and higher operational efforts for aeration and larval separation from the high-moisture residues. In contrast to the rearing system design, addition of the residue-derived microbial inoculum did not result in improved performance, nor did it alter intestinal and residue microbiota. Missing performance improvements could have been due to absent or low numbers of probiotic bacteria. The success of microbial substrate supplementation could be improved by studying effects of larval-associated microbes and developing cultivation methods that selectively amplify the beneficial (yet unknown) members of the microbial community. Our investigations aimed to increase the valorisation of low-value agri-food by-products in BSFL rearing.},

Insects can efficiently transform food substrates into reusable biomass, thus making them valuable contributors to a circular bioeconomy system. However, the relationship between the circular bioeconomy and the insect industry has so far appeared relatively unexplored in the existing research. To address this gap, a meta-synthesis has been conducted through a systematic literature review. By identifying the state of the art and assessing the role of insects in the transition of closed-loop systems, the aim of this research has been to shed light on the opportunities and challenges of integrating insects in circular bioeconomy strategies. The research revealed three main topics: (1) waste management by insects, i.e., the use of insects as a tool for waste management and with which to create high-value substrates; (2) insect-based feeds, namely the use of insects as alternative food sources in farming systems; (3) insect-based food acceptance by consumers. The results underscore the significant potential of this market within the circular bioeconomy context, highlighting the obstacles that need to be addressed and future strategies that could be adopted.},

  abstract = {Abstract Soil amended with poultry manure has many benefits including increased nutrient and organic carbon supply, enhanced soil structure and improved crop yield. However, the direct application of poultry manure to land can be associated with significant greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Black soldier fly (BSF) farming (Hermetia illucens) is an emerging technology that can convert manure into protein for animal feed, with larvae casting or frass produced as a waste by-product. BSF frass produced from poultry manure has potential to be used as a soil amendment with potentially lower GHG emissions than manure, but this has not been tested. To test this, a two-week microcosm experiment was used to investigate the impact of different soil amendments (poultry manure, BSF frass from poultry manure, urea and an unamended control) on nitrous oxide (N2O), carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) emissions. This study also aimed to examine bacterial populations associated with frass and poultry manure, as well as factors regulating their composition and the production of GHGs. Frass produced by BSF larvae fed poultry manure had up to 1.4 times lower N2O and 1.5 times lower CO2 cumulative emissions than poultry manure. Methane emissions were either minimal and/or balanced by oxidation across all treatments. Processing poultry manure with BSFL also altered the bacterial community composition and resulted in a proliferation of bacteria that were specific to BSFL frass, some of which have putative plant growth promoting properties. These results indicate that BSF technology holds promise for both reducing greenhouse gas emissions from poultry manure, as well as providing a sustainable soil amendment for productive agriculture.},

  abstract = {Agriculture is the second most important greenhouse gas (GHG: methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions)-emitting sector after the energy sector. Agriculture is also recognized as the source and sink of GHGs. The share of agriculture to the global GHG emission records has been widely investigated, but the impact on our food production systems has been overlooked for decades until the recent climate crisis. Livestock production and feed, nitrogen-rich fertilizers and livestock manure application, crop residue burning, as well as water management in flood-prone cultivation areas are components of agriculture that produce and emit most GHGs. Although agriculture produces 72–89\% less GHGs than other sectors, it is believed that reducing GHG emissions in agriculture would considerably lower its share of the global GHG emission records, which may lead to enormous benefits for the environment and food production systems. However, several diverging and controversial views questioning the actual role of plants in the current global GHG budget continue to nourish the debate globally. We must acknowledge that considering the beneficial roles of major GHGs to plants at a certain level of accumulation, implementing GHG mitigation measures from agriculture is indeed a complex task. This work provides a comprehensive review of agriculture-related GHG production and emission mechanisms, as well as GHG mitigation measures regarded as potential solutions available in the literature. This review also discusses in depth the significance and the dynamics of mitigation measures regarded as game changers with a high potential to enhance, in a sustainable manner, the resilience of agricultural systems. Some of the old but essential agricultural practices and livestock feed techniques are revived and discussed. Agricultural GHG mitigation approaches discussed in this work can serve as game changers in the attempt to reduce GHG emissions and alleviate the impact of climate change through sustainable agriculture and informed decision-making.},

  abstract = {To tackle the increasing challenges of agricultural production, the complex agricultural ecosystems need to be better understood. This can happen by means of modern digital technologies that monitor continuously the physical environment, producing large quantities of data in an unprecedented pace. The analysis of this (big) data would enable farmers and companies to extract value from it, improving their productivity. Although big data analysis is leading to advances in various industries, it has not yet been widely applied in agriculture. The objective of this paper is to perform a review on current studies and research works in agriculture which employ the recent practice of big data analysis, in order to solve various relevant problems. Thirty four different studies are presented, examining the problem they address, the proposed solution, tools, algorithms and data used, nature and dimensions of big data employed, scale of use as well as overall impact. Concluding, our review highlights the large opportunities of big data analysis in agriculture towards smarter farming, showing that the availability of hardware and software, techniques and methods for big data analysis, as well as the increasing openness of big data sources, shall encourage more academic research, public sector initiatives and business ventures in the agricultural sector. This practice is still at an early development stage and many barriers need to be overcome.},

  abstract = {Organic fertilizers have been identified as a sustainable agricultural practice that can enhance productivity and reduce environmental impact. Recently, the European Union defined and accepted insect frass as an innovative and emerging organic fertilizer. In the wider domain of organic fertilizers, mathematical and computational models have been developed to optimize their production and application conditions. However, with the advancement in policies and regulations, modelling has shifted towards efficiencies in the deployment of these technologies. Therefore, this paper reviews and critically analyzes the recent developments in the mathematical and computation modeling that have promoted various organic fertilizer products including insect frass. We reviewed a total of 35 studies and discussed the methodologies, benefits, and challenges associated with the use of these models. The results show that mathematical and computational modeling can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of organic fertilizer production, leading to improved agricultural productivity and reduced environmental impact. Mathematical models such as simulation, regression, dynamics, and kinetics have been applied while computational data driven machine learning models such as random forest, support vector machines, gradient boosting, and artificial neural networks have also been applied as well. These models have been used in quantifying nutrients concentration/release, effects of nutrients in agro-production, and fertilizer treatment. This paper also discusses prospects for the use of these models, including the development of more comprehensive and accurate models and integration with emerging technologies such as Internet of Things.},

  abstract = {Entomocomposting is fast and environmentally friendly, boosts soil quality and crop production, and improves resilience to climate change. The black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) catalyze the composting process, but their efficiency is highly influenced by environmental factors and the quality of the substrate. This study employs response surface methodology to discern physical–chemical factors that influence the nutrient quality of BSF frass fertilizer. Internet of Things (IoT) sensors were deployed to monitor in real-time both independent variables (air temperature, moisture content, humidity, and substrate temperature) and dependent variables (nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium); the data were relayed to the cloud. A non-linear regression model was used to study the relationship between the dependent and independent variables. Results showed that air humidity and air temperature did not have a significant effect on nitrogen and phosphorus accumulation in frass fertilizer, respectively, but phosphorus was significantly influenced by air humidity. On the other hand, neither air temperature nor moisture content has a significant effect on potassium concentration in frass fertilizer. We found that an air temperature of 30 °C and 41.5 °C, substrate temperature of 32.5 °C and 35 °C, moisture content between 70 and 80\%, and relative humidity beyond 38\% can be conducive for the production of high-quality BSF frass fertilizer. Model validation results showed better robustness of prediction with R2 values of 63–77\%, and Radj2 values of 62–76\% for nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium. Our findings highlight the potential for the application of digital tools as a fast and cost-effective decision support system to optimize insect farming for the production of high-quality frass fertilizer for use in sustainable agriculture and crop production.},

  abstract = {Black soldier fly (BSF) larvae (               Hermetia illucens               ) serve as a valuable protein source for animal feed. Limiting factors in the industrial rearing of BSF are the reproduction process and egg output. Studies indicate the potential to shorten preoviposition time and increase egg output through better utilization of environmental variables, such as temperature and light, in industrial settings. Excessive stimulation, however, can lead to stress, elevated production costs, and reduced egg numbers, emphasizing the need for a delicate balance. This study addresses these challenges by investigating controlled manipulation of environmental variables to stimulate mating and enhance egg production, thereby developing a comprehensive model encompassing the adult fly life cycle, mating, and egg production. Model parameters were fitted using literature data, and the model’s plausibility was tested through simulations. Using the model and optimal control methods, the calculated dynamic trajectories for environmental variables when compared to the standard approach in a constant environment demonstrated higher output and shorter production cycles at reasonable energy costs. Applications for this model-based optimization are demonstrated for various scenarios, highlighting the practical utility and versatility of the developed model. This study contributes valuable insights for improving rearing practices of BSF through environmental stimulation, offering potential advancements in egg production efficiency and overall sustainability.},

  abstract = {Black soldier fly (BSF) larvae (\textbackslash textit\{Hermetia illucens\}) are a valuable protein source for manufacturing animal feed. To maximize their production, both the quantity and quality of their reproductive cycle, i.e. egg production during oviposition, must be increased. In artificial environments, flies often sit idle in cages without mating, depleting their energy reserves and resulting in lower egg production per female. By controlling environmental conditions such as temperature and light inside breeding cages, the flies may be stimulated in a way that improves egg output. However, this stimulation increases the energy demand of the process and may stress the flies, resulting in reduced egg production. Therefore, control must be applied in a careful way, which requires knowledge of the egg production cycle. In this work, a mathematical model describing the various fly life stages and their transition to the egg production process is developed. Relevant factors are identified and their effect on the fly life and egg production is mathematically described. Parameters are identified using data from literature and goodness of fit is evaluated. Using the model, an optimal control problem is formulated with the goal of minimizing the energy costs and increasing the egg production quantity. In Simulation, our approach showed 13\textbackslash\% higher output in shorter time at reduced energy costs compared to a (standard) constant setpoint approach. Optimal control could reach same amount of egg in 60\textasciitilde\textbackslash\% of time compared to standard scenario.},

The aim of this research is to assess the feasibility of biodiesel production and its economic viability from BSF larvae. Specific objectives include analyzing organic waste quantity, moisture content, dry matter, BOD content, and biodiesel conversion efficiency. Our findings reveal that under various scales, biodiesel production from BSF larvae shows promise. For instance, in a small-scale urban biofuel plant, we estimate the production of approximately 122.73 liters of biodiesel per day from 1 ton of organic waste. Moreover, our calculations demonstrate the potential for medium-scale rural and large-scale industrial biofuel plants to produce 1,678.85 and 22,272.73 liters of biodiesel per day, respectively. These results highlight the significant biodiesel potential of BSF larvae. In conclusion, this study provides valuable insights into the biodiesel production potential of BSF larvae. It underscores the feasibility of utilizing organic waste for biodiesel production, contributing to sustainable biofuel development. Our research contributes to the knowledge base by offering quantitative assessments of biodiesel potential.

By integrating sensor technologies, automated control systems, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence algorithms, intelligent greenhouses facilitate precise monitoring and automated management of environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, light intensity, and soil moisture. This integration not only enhances crop yield and quality but also minimizes resource wastage. Nevertheless, the effective amalgamation of these technologies to achieve intelligent greenhouse environment management remains a primary research focus and challenge. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the current research status of intelligent greenhouses based on IoT control technology, addressing the following aspects: first, the utilization of microcontrollers and sensor technologies for localized monitoring and control of greenhouse environments; second, the implementation of cloud computing to enable remote monitoring and management of greenhouse conditions; third, the optimization of greenhouse environmental control strategies through the integration of artificial intelligence algorithms; and finally, the design of compact intelligent greenhouses suitable for domestic cultivation. This study systematically examines the research progress of intelligent greenhouses leveraging IoT control technologies, offering technical insights and practical applications for researchers in the field. Furthermore, the proposed integration frameworks and future development directions presented herein hold significant implications for advancing the adoption and expansion of smart agriculture, thereby contributing to the realization of intelligent and sustainable agricultural production systems.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Agriculture is a significant contributor to anthropogenic global warming, and reducing agricultural emissions—largely methane and nitrous oxide—could play a significant role in climate change mitigation. However, there are important differences between carbon dioxide (CO\textsubscript{2}), which is a stock pollutant, and methane (CH\textsubscript{4}), which is predominantly a flow pollutant. These dynamics mean that conventional reporting of aggregated CO\textsubscript{2}-equivalent emission rates is highly ambiguous and does not straightforwardly reflect historical or anticipated contributions to global temperature change. As a result, the roles and responsibilities of different sectors emitting different gases are similarly obscured by the common means of communicating emission reduction scenarios using CO\textsubscript{2}-equivalence. We argue for a shift in how we report agricultural greenhouse gas emissions and think about their mitigation to better reflect the distinct roles of different greenhouse gases. Policy-makers, stakeholders, and society at large should also be reminded that the role of agriculture in climate mitigation is a much broader topic than climate science alone can inform, including considerations of economic and technical feasibility, preferences for food supply and land-use, and notions of fairness and justice. A more nuanced perspective on the impacts of different emissions could aid these conversations.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {The research on black soldier fly (BSF; Hermetia illucens L.; Diptera: Stratiomyidae) rearing is on the rise. The larval ability to grow on organic substances makes it an ideal candidate for the bioconversion of agricultural and other organic side streams. While there are several publications on the variables influencing the growth and development of different stages of BSF, juxtaposing the results could be amiss. This is because of the different experimental approaches and units used by the researchers. A few publications also lack information that might be necessary for comparing the results when using similar substrate and rearing conditions. In this review, we have analyzed the studies on rearing variables such as the type of feeding substrate, substrate depth and aeration, substrate temperature, substrate moisture, pH, feeding rate, and larval density mainly, but not exclusively, for the larvae. For the adults, factors such as the cage size, fly density, light, ambient temperature, and relative humidity are considered. In addition, larval performance when fed with side streams is encapsulated. This provides a backbone for future researchers to identify the already assessed variables along with their range and encourages them to define and use standardized rearing practices for a better comparison of the results.},

  abstract = {The increasing levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere have become a major environmental challenge due to their contribution to global warming. The primary drivers of the increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations are the combustion of fossil fuels, deforestation, agricultural practices, or the production of cement, which play a significant role in the increase of CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. However, efforts are being made to mitigate the negative effects of CO2 emissions, including carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies that aim to capture CO2 from industrial processes and store it in underground geological formations. Methane, another potent greenhouse gas, is another major contributor to climate change and is mainly produced by agricultural activities such as livestock farming and rice cultivation. To address this, sustainable agricultural practices, such as reducing meat consumption and adopting climate-smart farming techniques, are crucial. Ultimately, a sustainable future can be secured for the planet and future generations by implementing effective measures, such as the use of sustainable energy sources, improvements in energy efficiency, responsible land use practices, and reducing the emissions of both CO2 and methane.},

  abstract = {Mass production of Hermetia illucens insect larvae is now being adopted in many countries and is taking an industrial production approach. Despite abundant literature on factors that affect larvae growth and the optimal static parameters identified in laboratory setup, for an industrial production process it is necessary to identify the trajectories such that the growth as well as the production process is optimal. To achieve this in this work, some of the important requirements and challenges involved thereof are identified and objectives of the automation process are formulated within a model based optimal control setup. Mechanistic models necessary for the optimization framework are derived as differential equations that describe the dynamic variation of resources (feed, water, O2 etc.), energy, and larval biomass. In addition, the elevated metabolic activity of larvae corresponding to the final instar development is identified and also modelled based on the observation from experiments. The mass and energy balance approach used in modelling enables the quantification and distinction of the mass and energy flux components in various levels (e.g. larvae body, growing medium, production environment, and external environment) while holding its applicability for both open and closed/reactor based production setups. Finally, the trajectories generated using the synthesized optimal controller are tested under different scenarios showcasing significant reduction in resource consumption compared to a constant set-point operation of the production setup. Results presented in this work not only showcase the potential of the mechanistic models and their application in identifying the relevant process parameters (e.g. reactor properties such as volume, thermal conductivity, actuator capacities), but most importantly in optimizing the process dynamically and tuning the process objectives as desired (e.g. maximize larvae mass, reduce energy).},

  abstract = {Abstract             The way governments and policy makers think about climate futures has a wide-ranging impact on how they formulate policy and plan for climate change impacts. In the lead-up to the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6), the IPCC adopted a new scenarios framework that aimed to provide a fuller picture of the interacting elements and policy choices that affect climate change. However, these scenarios, known as Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), are complex and difficult to communicate. Most audiences, including policy makers, receive much of their information about climate change from mainstream media, and particularly online news sites. We therefore examined the five most popular online news sites in the UK and the USA, five popular English-language news sites in India, English-language news media from a wide range of African countries, and the Reuters News agency. Based on manual content analysis to assess 252 articles, we identify several important findings, amongst them: in all countries, the media provide little detailed explanation of how scenarios are developed, very little mention of SSPs, and virtually no detailed explanations of them; generally, journalists use the words ‘projections’, ‘futures’, and ‘pathways’ when talking about the IPCC scenarios, although some usage of ‘predictions’ or ‘forecasts’ is apparent; contrary to previous research, there were very few doomsday narratives such as ‘only 12~years to act’. We conclude by drawing out some implications for more effective communication of the IPCC scenarios.},

The wastes bioconversion by the black soldier fly larva (BSFL) has two potential advantages: the larvae can convert the carbon and nitrogen in the biomass waste, and improve the properties of the substrate to reduce the loss of gaseous carbon and nitrogen. In the present study, the conversion rate of carbon, nitrogen and the emissions of greenhouse gases and NH3 during BSFL bio-treatment of food waste were investigated under different pH conditions. The results showed that the pH of the raw materials is a pivotal parameter affecting the process. The average wet weight of harvested BSFL was 13.26–95.28 mg/larva, with about 1.95–13.41\% and 5.40–18.93\% of recycled carbon and nitrogen from substrate at a pH from 3.0 to 11.0, respectively. Furthermore, pH is adversely correlated with CO2 emissions, but positively with NH3 emissions. Cumulative CO2, NH3, CH4 and N2O emissions at pH ranging from 3.0 to 11.0 were 88.15–161.11 g kg 1, 0.15–1.68 g kg 1, 0.19–2.62 mg kg 1 and 0.02–1.65 mg kg 1, respectively. Compared with the values in open composting, BSFL bio-treatment of food waste could lead greenhouse gas (especially CH4 and N2O) and NH3 emissions to decrease. Therefore, a higher pH value of the substrate can increase the larval output and help the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions.},

  abstract = {Black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) are acknowledged for their potential to upcycle waste biomass into animal feed, human food or biofuels. To ensure sustainable BSFL rearing, insight into nutrient bioconversion efficiencies and nutrient losses via gaseous emissions is key. This study used a mass balance approach to quantify nutrient bioconversion efficiencies (i.e., carbon, energy, nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium) and gaseous emissions (i.e., greenhouse gasses and ammonia) of BSFL reared on a substrate used in industrial production. On this substrate, bioconversion efficiencies ranged from 14\% (potassium) to 38\% (nitrogen). The proportion of dietary inputs found in the residues ranged from 55\% (energy) to 86\% (potassium), while the proportion of dietary inputs lost via gaseous emissions ranged from 1\% (nitrogen) to 24\% (carbon). Direct emissions of methane and nitrous oxide during rearing were 16.8 ± 8.6 g CO2equivalents per kg of dry BSFL biomass. Even though ammonia emissions were minimal, these could have been avoided if larvae would have been harvested before the CO2 peak was reached. Our results provide the first complete mass balance and comprehensive quantification of BSF larval metabolism and GHG emissions, required to assess and improve the environmental sustainability of BSFL production systems. © 2020 The Author(s).

  abstract = {IoT integrated Sensor Fusion is utilised in this work to estimate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. A system is proposed that utilizes IoT devices and environmental sensors to monitor and manage environmental impact efficiently in real-time. IoT-enabled sensors are strategically placed in industrial sites, metropolitan centres, and natural landscapes. These sensors measure CO2, methane, nitrous oxide, and meteorology. Sensor fusion and real time data monitoring are the main contribution of this research work. The technology decreases uncertainty and improves estimation accuracy by integrating sensor data. Machine learning algorithms analyse fused sensor data and create predictive models. These models allow the system to extrapolate emission estimates beyond sensor locations, providing a comprehensive view of GHG emissions across geographies. IoT integration with sensor fusion and digital signal processing (DSP) allows real-time data transmission and remote monitoring. This continuously collects and processes emission data to quickly identify pollution hotspots and conduct emission reduction actions. The system's precision, real-time capabilities, scalability, and adaptability make it ideal for local air quality monitoring, regional emission tracking, and global climate change assessments. Finally, this research uses sensor fusion and IoT technology to estimate GHG emissions. The technology provides accurate, real-time emission estimations from several sensors, aiding environmental monitoring and sustainable development. This strategy could help mitigate climate change and create a green future.},

  abstract = {Edible insects are considered a sustainable alternative protein source. Several studies have indicated that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from insects are generally low. These data were usually recorded in closed static chambers, which did not reflect the actual rearing conditions. On the other hand, open respiration chambers need high amounts of substrate and insects, making the analyses time consuming and expensive. In the present study, a novel small-scale open gas exchange recording system for evaluation of GHG emissions from insects is presented. The device consists of four independent respiration chambers, each one equipped with a pump for supplying air, a flow meter and a septum for sampling the flowing air. A validation experiment was carried out using black soldier fly larvae as model organisms and moistened chicken feed (dry matter 40\%) as rearing substrate. Three independent runs were conducted, each with two replicates, using 200 neonates larvae and 300 g of substrate. Moistened chicken feed (300 g) without larvae was used as control. Throughout the 12 days rearing period, gas sampling occurred every 12 h. Data interpolation considering a linear tendency between two successive sampling points was applied and overall amounts of gases were quantified as area under the curve. Irrespective of the run, CO2 emissions in the insect-substrate systems increased during the initial 7 d of experiment, consistently followed by a rapid decrease. Multiple cross correlation analysis showed high reproducibility (r ≥ 0.9), while significant differences in the CO2 emissions between insects-substrate system (range 7.76–11.88 g g 1 dry insects) and sole substrate (range 0.20–0.33 g g 1 initial dry substrate) were observed. Very limited N2O (≤1.13 mg g 1 dry insects) and CH4 (≤1.33 mg g 1 dry insects) emissions were detected in this experiment, indicating that the performed black soldier fly larvae rearing did not result in significant production of these GHGs. Overall, the experiment showed that the novel device may be particularly suited for quick and reliable estimation of GHG emissions from edible insects.},

Poor waste management leads to serious environmental issues at the local and global levels, for which an effective and sustainable waste disposal system is in urgent need. Due to its proven waste degradation and biotransformation capabilities, the Black Soldier Fly (BSF) provides a potential and economical alternative to recycling biological waste. The current study investigated the interactions between municipal and organic waste with the help of Black Soldier Fly Larvae (BSFL) as a growing medium for substrate culture by comparing the physicochemical parameters of waste before and after BSFL treatment of municipal and organic waste. The study results revealed that BSFL can improve the quality of the final product and promote the degradation of organic waste, although BSFL cannot effectively directly degrade municipal solid waste, it can reduce municipal solid waste by efficiently degrading organic waste. The optimal environmental conditions for BSFL breeding and growth was summarized in this study, and the environmental conditions of four seasons of four representative cities in different location of Pakistan were collected and analyzed. The most suitable cities for the development of the BSFL waste treatment system were first inferred, which makes basic research for developing an economical and feasible waste treatment system in Pakistan. A comprehensive legal framework regarding integrated MSW management systems should be introduced and implemented in Pakistan, including that local municipal authorities should collect the waste collection fee.},

  abstract = {The transition from food waste to food security is a critical component of sustainability efforts. This approach focuses on repurposing organic waste products generated throughout the food supply chain into valuable resources. Food waste, encompassing everything from agricultural residues to post-consumer waste, represents a significant untapped potential that can be harnessed to enhance food security. By implementing strategies such as composting, bioconversion, and innovative recycling technologies, biowastes can be transformed into fertilizers, animal feed, and even new food products, thus closing the loop in the food system and aiding sustainable solutions for waste valorization. This transition not only addresses environmental concerns by reducing landfill waste and greenhouse gas emissions but also contributes to economic sustainability by creating new opportunities within the food production and waste management sectors. Ultimately, transforming food waste into a resource aligns with the broader goals of a circular economy, ensuring a sustainable, resilient, and food-secure future.},

Secondly, the volume of organic waste produced will threaten human health and the quality of the environment. Recently, there is an increasing number of efforts placed into farming insect biomass to produce alternative feed ingredients. Black soldier fly larvae (BSFL), Hermetia illucens have proven to convert organic waste into high-quality nutrients for pet foods, fish and poultry feeds, as well as residue fertilizer for soil amendment. However, better BSFL feed formulation and feeding approaches are necessary for yielding a higher nutrient content of the insect body, and if performed efficiently, whilst converting waste into higher value biomass. Lastly, this paper reveals that BSFL, in fact, thrives in various ranges of organic matter composition and with simple rearing systems.},

  abstract = {Food security remains a pressing concern in the face of an increasing world population and environmental challenges. As climate change, biodiversity loss, and water scarcity continue to impact agricultural productivity, traditional livestock farming faces limitations in meeting the growing global demand for meat and dairy products. In this context, black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) have emerged as a promising alternative for sustainable food production. BSFL possess several advantages over conventional livestock, including their rapid growth, adaptability to various organic waste substrates, and low environmental impact. Their bioconversion rate, the ability to transform organic waste into valuable products, and final product optimization are key factors that enhance their potential as a nutrient-rich protein source, fertilizer, and biofuel. This review explores strategies to enhance the bioconversion rate and improve the end products derived from BSF treatment. It highlights the benefits of using BSFL over other interventions and underscores the significance of optimizing their bioconversion rate to meet the challenges of global food security sustainably. Despite the promising prospects of BSF-derived products, consumer acceptance and regulatory hurdles remain critical aspects to address in realizing their full market potential. The utilization of BSFL as a sustainable source of food and feed can contribute to waste management, reduce environmental pollution, and address the pressing issue of food security in an environmentally responsible manner. However, there is a need for further research and innovation to ensure the safety, quality, and economic viability of BSF-based products for both animal and human consumption.},

The resulting larvae or prepupae have a high protein and lipid content, primarily used as feed for fish, poultry, and other animals. The lipid content of BSF larvae/prepupae is influenced by the feed for growth and can reach up to 57.8\%. BSF lipids mainly consist of medium-chain saturated fatty acids, with lauric acid (LA) being the dominant component. The LA content in BSF larvae/prepupae can be enhanced by incorporating or utilizing substrates containing highly digestible carbohydrates for larval growth. The LA content can reach 76.13\% in larvae reared on fruit waste. LA has been reported to exhibit antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, and anticancer properties. Moreover, it has applications in various fields such as pharmaceuticals, food and beverages, cosmetics, body care, soaps and detergents, plastics, and textiles. This review aims to investigate the LA content in BSF larvae and explore its potential applications, thereby establishing BSF larvae/prepupae as a novel source of LA for diverse fields.},

  abstract = {Black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) is an emerging insect-based waste management agent as it provides effective biowaste conversion. Though effective, it requires certain environmental conditions that needs to be monitored regularly to make sure the BSFL can process the waste effectively. But, BSFL farmers are not always on site and the human resource is limited. Thus, remote monitoring system is needed to ease the monitoring process. By using the Internet of Things (IoT) for environmental condition monitoring, data collection from the sensors needs to be obtained in real-time. To do so, a scalable IoT messaging protocol called Message Queuing Telemetry Tracking (MQTT) for the data communiction is implemented. As the data will continuously be sent, a cloud server using Amazon Web Service Elastic Computing 2 (AWS EC2) virtual instance will be used to build the MQTT Broker and to run the data processing program that will processed the data before it is saved to a MySQL database. Using this system, data from the sensors located on the farm is succesfully sent to the MQTT broker, and the saved data in database is showing the same result as the sent data. It was also found that the average delay for data transmission is 0.8125 seconds. Thus, the proposed system has succesfully perform real time data communication using the MQTT protocol for BSFL monitoring system.},
