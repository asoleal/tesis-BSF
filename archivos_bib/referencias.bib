	abstract = {There are two major problems that we are facing currently. Firstly, a growing human population continues to contribute to the increased food demand. Secondly, the volume of organic waste produced will threaten human health and the quality of the environment. Recently, there is an increasing number of efforts placed into farming insect biomass to produce alternative feed ingredients. Black soldier fly larvae (BSFL), Hermetia illucens have proven to convert organic waste into high-quality nutrients for pet foods, fish and poultry feeds, as well as residue fertilizer for soil amendment. However, better BSFL feed formulation and feeding approaches are necessary for yielding a higher nutrient content of the insect body, and if performed efficiently, whilst converting waste into higher value biomass. Lastly, this paper reveals that BSFL, in fact, thrives in various ranges of organic matter composition and with simple rearing systems.},

	abstract = {Black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) are widely used in recycling and upcycling of nutrients in agri-food by-products, but low and inconsistent BSFL rearing performance (i.e. larval growth, bioconversion rate, and substrate reduction) has been identified as a key challenge. The aims of this research were two-fold: (1) validate an existing closed rearing system design; and (2) assess whether a microbial inoculum derived from the rearing residue increases rearing performance. In controlled bench-scale experiments, BSFL were reared on tomato pomace (TP) and white wine pomace (WWP), along with food waste as control substrate. The two aims were assessed based on the following response variables: larval mass, substrate reduction, residue properties (i.e. pH, temperature, moisture content), and larval intestinal and residue microbiota. Higher BSFL mass (by 5.1 mg dry mass) at harvest on WWP and substrate reduction on TP (by 11.7\% dry mass) in the closed system compared to the open system confirmed the potential of closed systems for rearing performance improvements of agri-food by-products. The rearing system also affected the residual moisture content and temperature, but only had a small effect on microbiota. Performance improvements by the closed rearing system design may be outweighed by insufficient aeration with pasty substrates and higher operational efforts for aeration and larval separation from the high-moisture residues. In contrast to the rearing system design, addition of the residue-derived microbial inoculum did not result in improved performance, nor did it alter intestinal and residue microbiota. Missing performance improvements could have been due to absent or low numbers of probiotic bacteria. The success of microbial substrate supplementation could be improved by studying effects of larval-associated microbes and developing cultivation methods that selectively amplify the beneficial (yet unknown) members of the microbial community. Our investigations aimed to increase the valorisation of low-value agri-food by-products in BSFL rearing.},

	abstract = {The research on black soldier fly (BSF; Hermetia illucens L.; Diptera: Stratiomyidae) rearing is on the rise. The larval ability to grow on organic substances makes it an ideal candidate for the bioconversion of agricultural and other organic side streams. While there are several publications on the variables influencing the growth and development of different stages of BSF, juxtaposing the results could be amiss. This is because of the different experimental approaches and units used by the researchers. A few publications also lack information that might be necessary for comparing the results when using similar substrate and rearing conditions. In this review, we have analyzed the studies on rearing variables such as the type of feeding substrate, substrate depth and aeration, substrate temperature, substrate moisture, pH, feeding rate, and larval density mainly, but not exclusively, for the larvae. For the adults, factors such as the cage size, fly density, light, ambient temperature, and relative humidity are considered. In addition, larval performance when fed with side streams is encapsulated. This provides a backbone for future researchers to identify the already assessed variables along with their range and encourages them to define and use standardized rearing practices for a better comparison of the results.},

This approach focuses on repurposing organic waste products generated throughout the food supply chain into valuable resources. Food waste, encompassing everything from agricultural residues to post-consumer waste, represents a significant untapped potential that can be harnessed to enhance food security. By implementing strategies such as composting, bioconversion, and innovative recycling technologies, biowastes can be transformed into fertilizers, animal feed, and even new food products, thus closing the loop in the food system and aiding sustainable solutions for waste valorization. This transition not only addresses environmental concerns by reducing landfill waste and greenhouse gas emissions but also contributes to economic sustainability by creating new opportunities within the food production and waste management sectors. Ultimately, transforming food waste into a resource aligns with the broader goals of a circular economy, ensuring a sustainable, resilient, and food-secure future.},

	abstract = {The agri-food industry is increasingly recognizing the environmental impact of the over-exploitation of natural resources and waste production, which has prompted a search for sustainable alternatives based on circular bioeconomy principles. Insects can efficiently transform food substrates into reusable biomass, thus making them valuable contributors to a circular bioeconomy system. However, the relationship between the circular bioeconomy and the insect industry has so far appeared relatively unexplored in the existing research. To address this gap, a meta-synthesis has been conducted through a systematic literature review. By identifying the state of the art and assessing the role of insects in the transition of closed-loop systems, the aim of this research has been to shed light on the opportunities and challenges of integrating insects in circular bioeconomy strategies. The research revealed three main topics: (1) waste management by insects, i.e., the use of insects as a tool for waste management and with which to create high-value substrates; (2) insect-based feeds, namely the use of insects as alternative food sources in farming systems; (3) insect-based food acceptance by consumers. The results underscore the significant potential of this market within the circular bioeconomy context, highlighting the obstacles that need to be addressed and future strategies that could be adopted.},

The experiment aimed to assess the effect of different substrate compositions on larval growth, chemical composition, and substrate temperature. BSFL were allocated to one of the four diets (control, vegetable, carnivorous, and omnivorous) for the entire experiment (8 days). The temperature was measured twice daily using a thermal-imaging camera, and the accumulated degree hours (ADH) was calculated. The results showed that the larvae fed the vegetable diet exhibited a significantly reduced growth performance, with a biomass reduction of 26.3\% compared to the control diet; furthermore, vegetable-fed larvae showed a lower dry matter content (−30\% compared to the average of other diets) due to lower fat content (−65\% compared to average of other diets). The nutritional composition of larvae fed an omnivorous diet was similar to larvae fed a high-quality substrate diet (control diet-chicken feed), indicating that the omnivorous diet could be an ideal solution for rearing BSFL larvae; however, the current European legislation prohibits the use of animal meal. The study also revealed that substrate temperatures did not have a discernible influence on larval growth, further emphasizing the importance of diet in BSFL rearing strategies.},

Poor waste management leads to serious environmental issues at the local and global levels, for which an effective and sustainable waste disposal system is in urgent need. Due to its proven waste degradation and biotransformation capabilities, the Black Soldier Fly (BSF) provides a potential and economical alternative to recycling biological waste. The current study investigated the interactions between municipal and organic waste with the help of Black Soldier Fly Larvae (BSFL) as a growing medium for substrate culture by comparing the physicochemical parameters of waste before and after BSFL treatment of municipal and organic waste. The study results revealed that BSFL can improve the quality of the final product and promote the degradation of organic waste, although BSFL cannot effectively directly degrade municipal solid waste, it can reduce municipal solid waste by efficiently degrading organic waste. The optimal environmental conditions for BSFL breeding and growth was summarized in this study, and the environmental conditions of four seasons of four representative cities in different location of Pakistan were collected and analyzed. The most suitable cities for the development of the BSFL waste treatment system were first inferred, which makes basic research for developing an economical and feasible waste treatment system in Pakistan. A comprehensive legal framework regarding integrated MSW management systems should be introduced and implemented in Pakistan, including that local municipal authorities should collect the waste collection fee.},

BSF lipids mainly consist of medium-chain saturated fatty acids, with lauric acid (LA) being the dominant component. The LA content in BSF larvae/prepupae can be enhanced by incorporating or utilizing substrates containing highly digestible carbohydrates for larval growth. The LA content can reach 76.13\% in larvae reared on fruit waste. LA has been reported to exhibit antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, and anticancer properties. Moreover, it has applications in various fields such as pharmaceuticals, food and beverages, cosmetics, body care, soaps and detergents, plastics, and textiles.

	abstract = {The transition from a linear to a circular production system involves transforming waste into valuable resources. Insect-mediated bioconversion, particularly using black soldier fly (BSF) larvae, can offer a promising opportunity to convert the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) into protein-rich biomass. However, current regulatory restrictions do not allow the use of this substrate to obtain insect proteins for animal feed, prompting the exploration of other applications, such as the production of bioplastics. Here, we explored at laboratory scale an innovative and integrated circular supply chain which aims to valorize the OFMSW through BSF larvae for the production of biobased materials with high technological value. BSF larvae reared on this organic waste showed excellent growth performance and bioconversion rate of the substrate. The use of well-suited extraction methods allowed the isolation of high-purity lipids, proteins, and chitin fractions, which are building blocks to produce biobased materials. In particular, the protein fraction was used to develop biodegradable plastic films which showed potential for replacing traditional petroleum-based materials, with the possibility to be fully recycled back to amino acids. Socioeconomic analysis highlighted values generated along the entire supply chain, and life cycle assessment pointed out that lipid extraction was the most challenging step: implementation of more sustainable methods is thus needed to reduce the overall environmental impact of the proposed chain. In conclusion, this study represents a proof of concept gathering evidence to support the feasibility of an alternative supply chain that can promote circular economy while valorising organic waste.},

	abstract = {Food security remains a pressing concern in the face of an increasing world population and environmental challenges. As climate change, biodiversity loss, and water scarcity continue to impact agricultural productivity, traditional livestock farming faces limitations in meeting the growing global demand for meat and dairy products. In this context, black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) have emerged as a promising alternative for sustainable food production. BSFL possess several advantages over conventional livestock, including their rapid growth, adaptability to various organic waste substrates, and low environmental impact. Their bioconversion rate, the ability to transform organic waste into valuable products, and final product optimization are key factors that enhance their potential as a nutrient-rich protein source, fertilizer, and biofuel. This review explores strategies to enhance the bioconversion rate and improve the end products derived from BSF treatment. It highlights the benefits of using BSFL over other interventions and underscores the significance of optimizing their bioconversion rate to meet the challenges of global food security sustainably. Despite the promising prospects of BSF-derived products, consumer acceptance and regulatory hurdles remain critical aspects to address in realizing their full market potential. The utilization of BSFL as a sustainable source of food and feed can contribute to waste management, reduce environmental pollution, and address the pressing issue of food security in an environmentally responsible manner. However, there is a need for further research and innovation to ensure the safety, quality, and economic viability of BSF-based products for both animal and human consumption.},

	abstract = {Data pipelines (i.e., converting raw data to features) are critical for machine learning (ML) models, yet their development and management is time-consuming. Feature stores have recently emerged as a new "DBMS-for-ML" with the premise of enabling data scientists and engineers to define and manage their data pipelines. While current feature stores fulfill their promise from a functionality perspective, they are resource-hungry---with ample opportunities for implementing database-style optimizations to enhance their performance. In this paper, we propose a novel set of optimizations specifically targeted for point-in-time join, which is a critical operation in data pipelines. We implement these optimizations on top of Feathr: a widely-used feature store, and evaluate them on use cases from both the TPCx-AI benchmark and real-world online retail scenarios. Our thorough experimental analysis shows that our optimizations can accelerate data pipelines by up to 3× over state-of-the-art baselines.},

	abstract = {A traceability system can quickly and accurately query product supply chain circulation information. It is difficult to obtain processing information and achieve sharing due to the big data, long duration, large amount of equipment and scattered and easily lost processing information. In tracing the application of the case-based reasoning (CBR) to product processing, we can solve the problem of establishing an accurate and complete mathematical model between the processing information and product quality defects by finding a target record in a large amount of historical data. The traceability model of ontology and CBR uses the web ontology language (OWL) for case representation to simplify the CBR framework for big data, classifies process data and standardizes information storage. A joint optimization algorithm based on the genetic algorithm (GA) and CBR is proposed to establish an optimization model of process traceability, which is applied to case retrieval and reuse. This algorithm optimizes the genetic operator by combining the optimal preservation strategy and roulette selection method and uses an exponential-scale transformation method to stretch the fitness function. The experiments show that the optimized traceability model can infer information from garbled codes, wrong codes and missing messages to quickly determine the problematic products, thus effectively improving the traceability accuracy of product processing.},

Quality of life, the green economy, and pollution management in society require comprehensive environmental monitoring systems with easy-to-use features and maintenance. This research suggests implementing a wireless sensor network with embedded sensor nodes manufactured using the Selective Surface Activation Induced by Laser technology. Such technology allows the integration of electrical circuits with free-form plastic sensor housing. In this work, a low-cost asynchronous web server for monitoring temperature and humidity sensors connected to the ESP32 Wi-Fi module has been developed. Data from sensor nodes across the facility are collected and displayed in real-time charts on a web server. Multiple web clients on the same network can access the sensor data. The energy to the sensor nodes could be powered by harvesting energy from surrounding sources of electromagnetic radiation. This automated and self-powered system monitors environmental and climatic factors, helps with timely action, and benefits sensor design by allowing antenna and rf-circuit formation on various plastics, even on the body of the device itself. It also provides greater flexibility in hardware modification and rapid large-scale deployment.},

Yet the lack of a single standardised method of measurement, when coupled with an inability to understand the true state of emissions in complex logistics activities, presents enormous barriers for businesses to understanding the extent of their emissions footprint. One of the traditional approaches to accurately capturing and monitoring gas emissions in logistics is through using gas sensors. However, connecting, maintaining, and operating gas sensors on moving vehicles in different road and weather conditions is a large and costly challenge. This paper presents the development and evaluation of a reliable and accurate sensing technique for GHG emissions collection (or monitoring) in real-time, employing the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to eliminate or reduce the usage of gas sensors, using reliable and cost-effective solutions.},

A system is proposed that utilizes IoT devices and environmental sensors to monitor and manage environmental impact efficiently in real-time. IoT-enabled sensors are strategically placed in industrial sites, metropolitan centres, and natural landscapes. These sensors measure CO2, methane, nitrous oxide, and meteorology. Sensor fusion and real time data monitoring are the main contribution of this research work. The technology decreases uncertainty and improves estimation accuracy by integrating sensor data. Machine learning algorithms analyse fused sensor data and create predictive models. These models allow the system to extrapolate emission estimates beyond sensor locations, providing a comprehensive view of GHG emissions across geographies. IoT integration with sensor fusion and digital signal processing (DSP) allows real-time data transmission and remote monitoring. This continuously collects and processes emission data to quickly identify pollution hotspots and conduct emission reduction actions. The system's precision, real-time capabilities, scalability, and adaptability make it ideal for local air quality monitoring, regional emission tracking, and global climate change assessments. Finally, this research uses sensor fusion and IoT technology to estimate GHG emissions. The technology provides accurate, real-time emission estimations from several sensors, aiding environmental monitoring and sustainable development.

	abstract = {The increase in solid waste generation is caused primarily by the global population growth that resulted in urban sprawl, economic development, and consumerism. Poor waste management has adverse impacts on the environment and human health. The recent years have seen increasing interest in using black soldier fly (BSF), Hermetia illucens, as an organic waste converter. Black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) feed voraciously on various types of organic waste, including food wastes, agro-industrial by-products, and chicken and dairy manure, and reduce the initial weight of the organic waste by about 50\% in a shorter period than conventional composting. The main components of the BSFL system are the larvero, where the larvae feed and grow, and the fly house, where the adults BSF live and reproduce. It is essential to have a rearing facility that maintains the healthy adult and larval BSF to provide a sufficient and continuous supply of offspring for organic waste treatment. The BSF organic waste processing facility consists of waste pre-processing, BSFL biowaste treatment, the separation of BSFL from the process residue, and larvae and residue refinement into marketable products. BSFL digest the nutrients in the wastes and convert them into beneficial proteins and fats used to produce animal feed, and BSFL residue can be used as an organic fertilizer. This review summarizes the BSFL treatment process to provide an in-depth understanding of the value of its by-products as animal feed and organic fertilizer.},

	abstract = {Background:
Hermetia illucens L. have gained popularity in recent years as an environmentally friendly response to both the present and potential future food/feed crisis. The larvae of
H. illucens L., or black soldier fly larvae (BSFL), is an alternative solution to tackle the issue of organic waste bioconversion. However, understanding the environmental loads associated with biowaste bioconversion using BSFL to produce dried BSFL is a pivotal point to keep the environment sustainable. This study reported a life cycle assessment (LCA) of the biowaste bioconversion process of BSFL and determined the environment impact analysis to make recommendations for modifications to lessen environmental consequences., 
Methods: The methodology used is life cycle assessment (LCA), which includes: (a) system boundary determination (gate-to-gate), starting from biowaste production, biowaste bioconversion, prepupae and BSFL frass production. The system boundary of the dried BSFL production is designed for both the processing and production of one cycle of BSFL; (b) life cycle inventory activities carried out at PT Biomagg Sinergi Internasional, Depok, West Java, Indonesia; (c) conducting life cycle impact assessment on five environmental impact categories namely global warming potential (GWP), acidification (AC), terrestrial eutrophication (TE), fossil fuel depletion (FFE), eco-toxicity (ET); and (d) interpretation of the assessment result. The LCA is conducted using openLCA 1.11 software and TRACI 2.1 impact assessment method., 
Results: The impact values of GWP, AC, TE, FFE, and ET, per 100 kg of BSFL dried production was 6.687 kg CO
2 eq; 0.029 kg SO
2-eq; 0.092 kg N-eq; 16.732 MJ surplus; 121.231 CTUe. Production of prepupa had the highest hotspots in these emissions, followed dried BSFL production., 
Conclusions: Efforts to reduce environmental impacts that can be done are by implementing an integrated rearing system using substrate from a single type of known substrate for BSFL and using alternative drying methods for BSFL dried production.},

However, efforts are being made to mitigate the negative effects of CO2 emissions, including carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies that aim to capture CO2 from industrial processes and store it in underground geological formations. Methane, another potent greenhouse gas, is another major contributor to climate change and is mainly produced by agricultural activities such as livestock farming and rice cultivation. To address this, sustainable agricultural practices, such as reducing meat consumption and adopting climate-smart farming techniques, are crucial. Ultimately, a sustainable future can be secured for the planet and future generations by implementing effective measures, such as the use of sustainable energy sources, improvements in energy efficiency, responsible land use practices, and reducing the emissions of both CO2 and methane.},

	abstract = {Climate change is defined as the shift in climate patterns mainly caused by greenhouse gas emissions from natural systems and human activities. So far, anthropogenic activities have caused about 1.0 °C of global warming above the pre-industrial level and this is likely to reach 1.5 °C between 2030 and 2052 if the current emission rates persist. In 2018, the world encountered 315 cases of natural disasters which are mainly related to the climate. Approximately 68.5 million people were affected, and economic losses amounted to \$131.7 billion, of which storms, floods, wildfires and droughts accounted for approximately 93\%. Economic losses attributed to wildfires in 2018 alone are almost equal to the collective losses from wildfires incurred over the past decade, which is quite alarming. Furthermore, food, water, health, ecosystem, human habitat and infrastructure have been identified as the most vulnerable sectors under climate attack. In 2015, the Paris agreement was introduced with the main objective of limiting global temperature increase to 2 °C by 2100 and pursuing efforts to limit the increase to 1.5 °C. This article reviews the main strategies for climate change abatement, namely conventional mitigation, negative emissions and radiative forcing geoengineering. Conventional mitigation technologies focus on reducing fossil-based CO2 emissions. Negative emissions technologies are aiming to capture and sequester atmospheric carbon to reduce carbon dioxide levels. Finally, geoengineering techniques of radiative forcing alter the earth’s radiative energy budget to stabilize or reduce global temperatures. It is evident that conventional mitigation efforts alone are not sufficient to meet the targets stipulated by the Paris agreement; therefore, the utilization of alternative routes appears inevitable. While various technologies presented may still be at an early stage of development, biogenic-based sequestration techniques are to a certain extent mature and can be deployed immediately.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Agriculture is a significant contributor to anthropogenic global warming, and reducing agricultural emissions—largely methane and nitrous oxide—could play a significant role in climate change mitigation. However, there are important differences between carbon dioxide (CO$_{\textrm{2}}$), which is a stock pollutant, and methane (CH$_{\textrm{4}}$), which is predominantly a flow pollutant. These dynamics mean that conventional reporting of aggregated CO$_{\textrm{2}}$-equivalent emission rates is highly ambiguous and does not straightforwardly reflect historical or anticipated contributions to global temperature change. As a result, the roles and responsibilities of different sectors emitting different gases are similarly obscured by the common means of communicating emission reduction scenarios using CO$_{\textrm{2}}$-equivalence. We argue for a shift in how we report agricultural greenhouse gas emissions and think about their mitigation to better reflect the distinct roles of different greenhouse gases. Policy-makers, stakeholders, and society at large should also be reminded that the role of agriculture in climate mitigation is a much broader topic than climate science alone can inform, including considerations of economic and technical feasibility, preferences for food supply and land-use, and notions of fairness and justice. A more nuanced perspective on the impacts of different emissions could aid these conversations.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Agriculture is the second most important greenhouse gas (GHG: methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions)-emitting sector after the energy sector. Agriculture is also recognized as the source and sink of GHGs. The share of agriculture to the global GHG emission records has been widely investigated, but the impact on our food production systems has been overlooked for decades until the recent climate crisis. Livestock production and feed, nitrogen-rich fertilizers and livestock manure application, crop residue burning, as well as water management in flood-prone cultivation areas are components of agriculture that produce and emit most GHGs. Although agriculture produces 72–89\% less GHGs than other sectors, it is believed that reducing GHG emissions in agriculture would considerably lower its share of the global GHG emission records, which may lead to enormous benefits for the environment and food production systems. However, several diverging and controversial views questioning the actual role of plants in the current global GHG budget continue to nourish the debate globally. We must acknowledge that considering the beneficial roles of major GHGs to plants at a certain level of accumulation, implementing GHG mitigation measures from agriculture is indeed a complex task. This work provides a comprehensive review of agriculture-related GHG production and emission mechanisms, as well as GHG mitigation measures regarded as potential solutions available in the literature. This review also discusses in depth the significance and the dynamics of mitigation measures regarded as game changers with a high potential to enhance, in a sustainable manner, the resilience of agricultural systems. Some of the old but essential agricultural practices and livestock feed techniques are revived and discussed. Agricultural GHG mitigation approaches discussed in this work can serve as game changers in the attempt to reduce GHG emissions and alleviate the impact of climate change through sustainable agriculture and informed decision-making.},

	abstract = {Recent climate variability, limited fertile land availability and soil degradation are major constraints to achieve food security for an ever-increasing human population. The adoption of intensive agriculture practices and highly productive agrosystems coupled with intensive use of agrochemicals has caused significant increases in agriculture production worldwide. This exhaustive production system has caused significant increases in generation and accumulation of large quantities organic wastes, which cause environmental pollution, deteriorate soil health and increase public health hazards. Conventional methods of organic waste management such as in situ burning of organic wastes, landfilling and chemical degradation are labour intensive, expensive and highly energy-consuming, and negatively impact the environment. Therefore, sustainable, eco-friendly and socially acceptable agri-technologies have been developed for value-added management of organic wastes and to obviate pollution problem. These biological technologies such as composting, anaerobic digestion, vermicomposting, production of biochar, organic phytostimulants, and bioremediation of pollutants have opened new vista for organic waste management. The addition of processed organic amendments (i.e., compost, vermicompost, biogas slurry and biochar) to the soil increases soil organic matter and nutrients availability, stimulates soil microbial community, contributes towards biocontrol of pathogens and also causes detoxification of pesticides. Furthermore, soil amendment with processed organic waste material, singly or with beneficial microbes, improved soil health, promoted growth of plants and increased the crop yields with less dependency on chemical fertilizers. In this article, the current technologies used for management of accumulated organic wastes are discussed for improving sustainable crop production, while maintaining environmental sustainability.},
