  abstract = {The AI-controlled Smart IoT-based Greenhouse Monitoring System represents a cutting-edge solution for precision agriculture. Leveraging the power of Artificial Intelligence and the Internet of Things, this system continuously monitors and optimizes environmental variables within the greenhouse, including temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and light levels. Greenhouse gases are the gases in the atmosphere that raise the surface temperature of Earth. Water vapor (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and Ozone (O3) are some of the examples for greenhouse gases. This article provides an overview of such an automation workflow in greenhouse environments by means of distributed wireless nodes. It makes use of both the IoT and AI technique. Predictions are made through the AI technique which makes use of CNN approach. After a comparative study, sample results from commercial and research greenhouse experiments with the IoT hardware and software have been provided to show connection stability, robustness, and reliability.},

  abstract = {At the dawn of the fourth industrial revolution, we are witnessing a fast and widespread adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in our daily life, which contributes to accelerating the shift towards a more algorithmic society. However, even with such unprecedented advancements, a key impediment to the use of AI-based systems is that they often lack transparency. Indeed, the black-box nature of these systems allows powerful predictions, but it cannot be directly explained. This issue has triggered a new debate on explainable AI (XAI). A research field holds substantial promise for improving trust and transparency of AI-based systems. It is recognized as the sine qua non for AI to continue making steady progress without disruption. This survey provides an entry point for interested researchers and practitioners to learn key aspects of the young and rapidly growing body of research related to XAI. Through the lens of the literature, we review the existing approaches regarding the topic, discuss trends surrounding its sphere, and present major research trajectories.},

  abstract = {Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) are pivotal for real-time monitoring in diverse sectors through the Internet of Things (IoT). However, current wireless communication protocols face challenges in integrating Precision Agriculture (PA) management systems with Artificial Intelligence (AI). PA optimizes nutrient supply and pesticide use, enhancing crop yield and product quality. Despite these advantages, structural changes in WSNs, including deployment, coverage, scalability, and energy consumption, hinder their potential. This paper conducts a comparative study of WSNs in agriculture, focusing on wireless protocols, energy harvesting, and efficiency procedures. The research delves into challenges faced by WSNs in agriculture, emphasizing the need for power-saving agricultural management strategies to ensure sustained, effective long-term monitoring. The study addresses integration issues, explores agricultural benefits, and proposes solutions to enhance WSN performance in dynamic field environments.},

  abstract = {Municipal solid waste is one of the most significant sources of gas emissions. In a context of renewable energy production and greenhouse gas emission reduction, we focus on the amount of biogas produced by the anaerobic digestion of organic matter in a controlled landfill environment. We present a mathematical model describing this process from a microbiological and biochemical point of view, including the dynamics of the methane and carbon dioxide produced. A qualitative analysis of the dynamic system shows the existence of an infinite number of non-hyperbolic equilibria inducing an attractor that has been identified. Through numerical tests, we explore how the non-connectivity of the attractor resulting from the choice of growth functions can entirely transform the performance of the process, and highlight critical initial stock values that influence the amount of biogas produced.},

Poor waste management has adverse impacts on the environment and human health. The recent years have seen increasing interest in using black soldier fly (BSF), Hermetia illucens, as an organic waste converter. Black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) feed voraciously on various types of organic waste, including food wastes, agro-industrial by-products, and chicken and dairy manure, and reduce the initial weight of the organic waste by about 50\% in a shorter period than conventional composting. The main components of the BSFL system are the larvero, where the larvae feed and grow, and the fly house, where the adults BSF live and reproduce. It is essential to have a rearing facility that maintains the healthy adult and larval BSF to provide a sufficient and continuous supply of offspring for organic waste treatment. The BSF organic waste processing facility consists of waste pre-processing, BSFL biowaste treatment, the separation of BSFL from the process residue, and larvae and residue refinement into marketable products. BSFL digest the nutrients in the wastes and convert them into beneficial proteins and fats used to produce animal feed, and BSFL residue can be used as an organic fertilizer.

The analysis revealed that black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) have proven effective in the bioconversion of common waste, such as household and livestock waste, yielding valuable biomass. Despite these advancements, the exploration of new sources of organic matter persists to mitigate its environmental impact. Emerging technologies enable the efficient processing of BSFL biomass, yielding substitutes for environmentally unfriendly materials. Although the literature emphasizes the advantages of BSF in constructing circular economy models, obstacles such as limited legislation and insufficient incentives for producers, concerns about pathogens and contaminants, and low public acceptance of this species are identified. However, the growing trend in scientific interest suggests that BSF could play a central role in building sustainable societies in the future.},

The analysis revealed that black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) have proven effective in the bioconversion of common waste, such as household and livestock waste, yielding valuable biomass. Despite these advancements, the exploration of new sources of organic matter persists to mitigate its environmental impact. Emerging technologies enable the efficient processing of BSFL biomass, yielding substitutes for environmentally unfriendly materials. Although the literature emphasizes the advantages of BSF in constructing circular economy models, obstacles such as limited legislation and insufficient incentives for producers, concerns about pathogens and contaminants, and low public acceptance of this species are identified. However, the growing trend in scientific interest suggests that BSF could play a central role in building sustainable societies in the future.},

  abstract = {The black soldier fly (BSF) is recognised as a valuable insect for mitigating feed and organic waste management challenges. Thus, concerted efforts are being directed toward the promotion of the BSF. Despite the numerous advantages of BSF larvae, there are several critical environmental aspects, particularly its global warming potential, that need to be considered before large-scale adoption due to the complexity of the insect’s value chain. The direct assessment of greenhouse gas (GHG) and ammonia emissions from BSF larvae biotreatment is crucial for conducting a life cycle assessment (LCA) to evaluate the insect products’ environmental performance. This article reviews the emissions of GHG from BSF larvae bioconversion activities based on different gas sensing techniques while highlighting the factors that influence these emissions. Generally, low gas emissions were reported. However, the influence of various factors influencing emissions remains unclear, especially for nitrous oxide. We also analysed LCA studies on BSFL products while emphasising the uncertainties and variabilities among the studies. The wide variation of impact scores reported in the studies suggests that standardised guidelines should be developed to streamline methodical approaches for impact assessments pertaining to system boundaries, functional units, allocation, and system expansion assumptions. We identified several aspects for future improvements to harmonise studies in order to enhance the comparative assessment of the BSFL products.},

  abstract = {Larvae of the black soldier fly, Hermetia illucens (Diptera: Stratiomyidae), are voracious feeders of organic material and may thus be used in simple engineered systems to reduce organic waste in low- and middle-income countries. Controlled feeding experiments with standard fodder were conducted to assess the optimum amount of organic waste to be added to a CORS system (Conversion of Organic Refuse by Saprophages). A daily feeding rate of 100 mg chicken feed (60\% moisture content) per larva resulted in an optimum trade-off between material reduction efficiency (41.8\%, SE 0.61) and biomass production (prepupal dry weight: 48.0 mg, SE 2.0). Applied to market waste and human faeces, this corresponds to a potential daily feeding capacity of 3?5 kg/m2 and 6.5 kg/m2, respectively. In addition, H. illucens prepupae quality was assessed to determine their suitability to substitute fishmeal in animal feed production. The chitin-corrected crude protein content ranged from 28.2 to 42.5\%, depending on the amount of food provided to the larvae. Based on our study, a waste processing unit could yield a daily prepupal biomass of 145 g (dry mass) per m2. We conclude that larvae of the black soldier fly are potentially capable of converting large amounts of organic waste into protein-rich biomass to substitute fishmeal, thereby contributing to sustainable aquaculture.},

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of the larvae in reducing and converting mixtures of fresh food waste (FW) with other organic waste types, i.e., immature windrow composting material (IW), residue windrow composting material (RW), and fresh cow manure (CM) at three different composition ratios. The growth rate and protein content of the larvae were also determined in this study. A specific amount of organic waste mixtures was fed to the BSF larvae. The results suggest that the type of organic waste given to larvae affected the overall waste reduction and larval growth at a certain extent. The composition ratio of FW with the other wastes used was 90:10, 70:30, and 60:40 (w/w). The highest reduction percentage was at the ratio of 90:10 achieved for FW mixed with IW, FW mixed with RW, and FW mixed with CM, i.e. 82.2\%, 79\%, and 74.5\% respectively. The protein content of larvae in those waste mixtures was 54.6\%, 63.1\%, and 48.75\% respectively. The final residue from the decomposition of the waste by BSF larvae was also observed in this study.}

The climatic condition is believed to be biannual dry seasons which is very difficult for farmers to cultivate crops due to shortage of water and poor soil fertility. Yet heavy rainfall is still a great threat for the farmers since it devastates cash crops. The use of a smart greenhouse with Artificial Intelligence to grow and protect plants in both dry and wet seasons and reduce labor-intensive human tasks and automate pervasive data analytics of daily plant status can surprisingly boost food security. Here we present a fully automated greenhouse system with artificial intelligence embedded in it that uses around 10,000 plant images in it that initially nurtureplants under optimum atmospheric conditions by taking real-time decisions, detectingany kind of illness, and interestingly notifyingthe stage of fruit ripeness. By implementing a neural network-based computer vision approach we were able to keep track of the health status of the plants caused by several microorganisms. The obtained predictions and results accurately verify how machine learning can be used to increase gross national food security by implementing such systems in multiple farming areas without prior human involvement.},

So far, anthropogenic activities have caused about 1.0~°C of global warming above the pre-industrial level and this is likely to reach 1.5~°C between 2030 and 2052 if the current emission rates persist. In 2018, the world encountered 315 cases of natural disasters which are mainly related to the climate. Approximately 68.5 million people were affected, and economic losses amounted to \$131.7 billion, of which storms, floods, wildfires and droughts accounted for approximately 93\%.

This article reviews the main strategies for climate change abatement, namely conventional mitigation, negative emissions and radiative forcing geoengineering. Conventional mitigation technologies focus on reducing fossil-based CO2 emissions. Negative emissions technologies are aiming to capture and sequester atmospheric carbon to~reduce carbon dioxide levels.

In this study, weight gain data from BSF larvae fed diets with distinct nutrient compositions were used to build a machine learning model. Among the algorithms tested, the XGBoost model demonstrated the best performance in predicting weight gain. The model identified protein as the most critical nutrient factor for larval biomass and was used to determine the optimal diet by calculating the highest weight gain from 30,000 randomly generated nutrient combinations. Supplementing the missing nutrients in organic waste according to the optimal diet improved the weight gain and feed conversion rate of BSF larvae. Feeding larvae a mixture of organic wastes, a costeffective strategy to meet dietary nutrition requirements, resulted in significant increases in both the bioconversion rate (up to 9.7\%) and mass reduction rate (up to 22.8\%) of organic waste.},

The results highlight that the carbon footprint associated with fresh larva production is approximately thirty times lower than that of conventional animal farming, aligning with sustainable practices and offering a promising alternative in the quest for eco-friendly protein sources. Moreover, the water footprint of the black soldier fly farm is significantly lower than that of traditional animal farms, underscoring the environmental advantages of this innovative approach to larva production over conventional livestock farming. These valuable insights contribute substantively to the ongoing discourse on sustainable and responsible agricultural practices, paving the way for more environmentally friendly solutions in the ever-evolving landscape of sustainable food production practices.},

  abstract = {Black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) are widely used in recycling and upcycling of nutrients in agri-food by-products, but low and inconsistent BSFL rearing performance (i.e. larval growth, bioconversion rate, and substrate reduction) has been identified as a key challenge. The aims of this research were two-fold: (1) validate an existing closed rearing system design; and (2) assess whether a microbial inoculum derived from the rearing residue increases rearing performance. In controlled bench-scale experiments, BSFL were reared on tomato pomace (TP) and white wine pomace (WWP), along with food waste as control substrate. The two aims were assessed based on the following response variables: larval mass, substrate reduction, residue properties (i.e. pH, temperature, moisture content), and larval intestinal and residue microbiota. Higher BSFL mass (by 5.1 mg dry mass) at harvest on WWP and substrate reduction on TP (by 11.7\% dry mass) in the closed system compared to the open system confirmed the potential of closed systems for rearing performance improvements of agri-food by-products. The rearing system also affected the residual moisture content and temperature, but only had a small effect on microbiota. Performance improvements by the closed rearing system design may be outweighed by insufficient aeration with pasty substrates and higher operational efforts for aeration and larval separation from the high-moisture residues. In contrast to the rearing system design, addition of the residue-derived microbial inoculum did not result in improved performance, nor did it alter intestinal and residue microbiota. Missing performance improvements could have been due to absent or low numbers of probiotic bacteria. The success of microbial substrate supplementation could be improved by studying effects of larval-associated microbes and developing cultivation methods that selectively amplify the beneficial (yet unknown) members of the microbial community. Our investigations aimed to increase the valorisation of low-value agri-food by-products in BSFL rearing.},

  abstract = {Black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) are highly efficient at converting organic substrates into insect biomass suitable for livestock nutrition. BSFL conversion efficiency depends on the nature of their feed, and formulation approaches use macronutrient contents to reach a targeted performance. However, digestibility varies between ingredients and BSFL digestibility data is lacking due to methods unsuitable for insects living in their feed. This study proposes to work under a range of larval densities to reach total ingestion of the feed, and defines Estimated Digestibility (ED) as the difference between distributed feed and frass macronutrient weight, divided by macronutrient weight in distributed feed. Using the same amount of chicken feed, same feeding time and 0 to 29 larvae/cm               2               , ED of dry mass (DM), starch, nitrogen, ether extract (EE), neutral detergent fibre, acid detergent fibre, acid detergent lignin, ash and energy were evaluated, along with survival rate, feed conversion ratio (FCR) and larval individual mass gain on a fresh and dry basis. ED of DM, starch, nitrogen, EE and energy increased with larval density following an asymptotic trend. ED of ash increased between 0 and 11.4 larvae/cm2 but decreased for higher densities. Using a logistic model, asymptotic ED of DM (80.3±1.3\%), starch (99.0±2.3\%), nitrogen (78.6±1.1\%), EE (95.3±1.5\%), ash (58.4±1.0\%) and energy (80.6±1.2\%) were determined. No effect of areal density on ED of fibre fractions was detected. Survival rate and individual mass gain peaked at densities below 5 larvae/cm               2               , FCR (dry to fresh) was improved with increasing density, while FCR (dry to dry) was optimised at 11.4 larvae/cm               2               . Asymptotic ED is a new indicator corresponding to the maximal fraction of macronutrients potentially digestible by BSFL. It should be used to develop a diet formulation approach based on digestible rather than crude macronutrient contents. Further studies should focus on evaluating asymptotic ED in different ingredients.},

  abstract = {Abstract Soil amended with poultry manure has many benefits including increased nutrient and organic carbon supply, enhanced soil structure and improved crop yield. However, the direct application of poultry manure to land can be associated with significant greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Black soldier fly (BSF) farming (Hermetia illucens) is an emerging technology that can convert manure into protein for animal feed, with larvae casting or frass produced as a waste by-product. BSF frass produced from poultry manure has potential to be used as a soil amendment with potentially lower GHG emissions than manure, but this has not been tested. To test this, a two-week microcosm experiment was used to investigate the impact of different soil amendments (poultry manure, BSF frass from poultry manure, urea and an unamended control) on nitrous oxide (N2O), carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) emissions. This study also aimed to examine bacterial populations associated with frass and poultry manure, as well as factors regulating their composition and the production of GHGs. Frass produced by BSF larvae fed poultry manure had up to 1.4 times lower N2O and 1.5 times lower CO2 cumulative emissions than poultry manure. Methane emissions were either minimal and/or balanced by oxidation across all treatments. Processing poultry manure with BSFL also altered the bacterial community composition and resulted in a proliferation of bacteria that were specific to BSFL frass, some of which have putative plant growth promoting properties. These results indicate that BSF technology holds promise for both reducing greenhouse gas emissions from poultry manure, as well as providing a sustainable soil amendment for productive agriculture.},

  abstract = {To tackle the increasing challenges of agricultural production, the complex agricultural ecosystems need to be better understood. This can happen by means of modern digital technologies that monitor continuously the physical environment, producing large quantities of data in an unprecedented pace. The analysis of this (big) data would enable farmers and companies to extract value from it, improving their productivity. Although big data analysis is leading to advances in various industries, it has not yet been widely applied in agriculture. The objective of this paper is to perform a review on current studies and research works in agriculture which employ the recent practice of big data analysis, in order to solve various relevant problems. Thirty four different studies are presented, examining the problem they address, the proposed solution, tools, algorithms and data used, nature and dimensions of big data employed, scale of use as well as overall impact. Concluding, our review highlights the large opportunities of big data analysis in agriculture towards smarter farming, showing that the availability of hardware and software, techniques and methods for big data analysis, as well as the increasing openness of big data sources, shall encourage more academic research, public sector initiatives and business ventures in the agricultural sector. This practice is still at an early development stage and many barriers need to be overcome.},

  abstract = {Organic fertilizers have been identified as a sustainable agricultural practice that can enhance productivity and reduce environmental impact. Recently, the European Union defined and accepted insect frass as an innovative and emerging organic fertilizer. In the wider domain of organic fertilizers, mathematical and computational models have been developed to optimize their production and application conditions. However, with the advancement in policies and regulations, modelling has shifted towards efficiencies in the deployment of these technologies. Therefore, this paper reviews and critically analyzes the recent developments in the mathematical and computation modeling that have promoted various organic fertilizer products including insect frass. We reviewed a total of 35 studies and discussed the methodologies, benefits, and challenges associated with the use of these models. The results show that mathematical and computational modeling can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of organic fertilizer production, leading to improved agricultural productivity and reduced environmental impact. Mathematical models such as simulation, regression, dynamics, and kinetics have been applied while computational data driven machine learning models such as random forest, support vector machines, gradient boosting, and artificial neural networks have also been applied as well. These models have been used in quantifying nutrients concentration/release, effects of nutrients in agro-production, and fertilizer treatment. This paper also discusses prospects for the use of these models, including the development of more comprehensive and accurate models and integration with emerging technologies such as Internet of Things.},

  abstract = {Entomocomposting is fast and environmentally friendly, boosts soil quality and crop production, and improves resilience to climate change. The black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) catalyze the composting process, but their efficiency is highly influenced by environmental factors and the quality of the substrate. This study employs response surface methodology to discern physical–chemical factors that influence the nutrient quality of BSF frass fertilizer. Internet of Things (IoT) sensors were deployed to monitor in real-time both independent variables (air temperature, moisture content, humidity, and substrate temperature) and dependent variables (nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium); the data were relayed to the cloud. A non-linear regression model was used to study the relationship between the dependent and independent variables. Results showed that air humidity and air temperature did not have a significant effect on nitrogen and phosphorus accumulation in frass fertilizer, respectively, but phosphorus was significantly influenced by air humidity. On the other hand, neither air temperature nor moisture content has a significant effect on potassium concentration in frass fertilizer. We found that an air temperature of 30 °C and 41.5 °C, substrate temperature of 32.5 °C and 35 °C, moisture content between 70 and 80\%, and relative humidity beyond 38\% can be conducive for the production of high-quality BSF frass fertilizer. Model validation results showed better robustness of prediction with R2 values of 63–77\%, and Radj2 values of 62–76\% for nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium. Our findings highlight the potential for the application of digital tools as a fast and cost-effective decision support system to optimize insect farming for the production of high-quality frass fertilizer for use in sustainable agriculture and crop production.},

  abstract = {Black soldier fly (BSF) larvae (\textbackslash textit\{Hermetia illucens\}) are a valuable protein source for manufacturing animal feed. To maximize their production, both the quantity and quality of their reproductive cycle, i.e. egg production during oviposition, must be increased. In artificial environments, flies often sit idle in cages without mating, depleting their energy reserves and resulting in lower egg production per female. By controlling environmental conditions such as temperature and light inside breeding cages, the flies may be stimulated in a way that improves egg output. However, this stimulation increases the energy demand of the process and may stress the flies, resulting in reduced egg production. Therefore, control must be applied in a careful way, which requires knowledge of the egg production cycle. In this work, a mathematical model describing the various fly life stages and their transition to the egg production process is developed. Relevant factors are identified and their effect on the fly life and egg production is mathematically described. Parameters are identified using data from literature and goodness of fit is evaluated. Using the model, an optimal control problem is formulated with the goal of minimizing the energy costs and increasing the egg production quantity. In Simulation, our approach showed 13\textbackslash\% higher output in shorter time at reduced energy costs compared to a (standard) constant setpoint approach. Optimal control could reach same amount of egg in 60\textasciitilde\textbackslash\% of time compared to standard scenario.},

  abstract = {Efforts to divert organics away from landfills are viewed by many as an important measure to significantly reduce the climate change impacts of municipal solid waste management. However, the actual greenhouse gas (GHG) impacts of organics diversion from landfills have yet to be thoroughly evaluated and whether such a diversion provides significant environmental benefits in terms of GHG impacts must be answered. This study, using California-specific information, aimed to analyse the GHG impacts of organics diversion through a life-cycle assessment (LCA). This LCA considered all aspects of organics management including transportation, materials handling, GHG emissions, landfill gas capture/utilization, energy impacts, and carbon sequestration. The LCA study evaluated overall GHG impacts of landfilling, and alternative management options such as composting and anaerobic digestion for diverted organic waste. The LCA analysis resulted in net GHG reductions of 0.093, 0.048, 0.065 and 0.073 tonnes carbon equivalent per tonne organic waste for landfilling, windrow composting, aerated static pile composting, and anaerobic digestion, respectively. This study confirms that all three options for organics management result in net reductions of GHG emissions, but it also shows that organics landfilling, when well-managed, generates greater GHG reductions. The LCA provides scientific insight with regards to the environmental impacts of organics management options, which should be considered in decision and policy-making. The study also highlights the importance of how site and case-specific conditions influence project outcomes when considering organic waste management options.},

By integrating sensor technologies, automated control systems, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence algorithms, intelligent greenhouses facilitate precise monitoring and automated management of environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, light intensity, and soil moisture. This integration not only enhances crop yield and quality but also minimizes resource wastage. Nevertheless, the effective amalgamation of these technologies to achieve intelligent greenhouse environment management remains a primary research focus and challenge. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the current research status of intelligent greenhouses based on IoT control technology, addressing the following aspects: first, the utilization of microcontrollers and sensor technologies for localized monitoring and control of greenhouse environments; second, the implementation of cloud computing to enable remote monitoring and management of greenhouse conditions; third, the optimization of greenhouse environmental control strategies through the integration of artificial intelligence algorithms; and finally, the design of compact intelligent greenhouses suitable for domestic cultivation. This study systematically examines the research progress of intelligent greenhouses leveraging IoT control technologies, offering technical insights and practical applications for researchers in the field. Furthermore, the proposed integration frameworks and future development directions presented herein hold significant implications for advancing the adoption and expansion of smart agriculture, thereby contributing to the realization of intelligent and sustainable agricultural production systems.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Agriculture is a significant contributor to anthropogenic global warming, and reducing agricultural emissions—largely methane and nitrous oxide—could play a significant role in climate change mitigation. However, there are important differences between carbon dioxide (CO\textsubscript{2}), which is a stock pollutant, and methane (CH\textsubscript{4}), which is predominantly a flow pollutant. These dynamics mean that conventional reporting of aggregated CO\textsubscript{2}-equivalent emission rates is highly ambiguous and does not straightforwardly reflect historical or anticipated contributions to global temperature change. As a result, the roles and responsibilities of different sectors emitting different gases are similarly obscured by the common means of communicating emission reduction scenarios using CO\textsubscript{2}-equivalence. We argue for a shift in how we report agricultural greenhouse gas emissions and think about their mitigation to better reflect the distinct roles of different greenhouse gases. Policy-makers, stakeholders, and society at large should also be reminded that the role of agriculture in climate mitigation is a much broader topic than climate science alone can inform, including considerations of economic and technical feasibility, preferences for food supply and land-use, and notions of fairness and justice. A more nuanced perspective on the impacts of different emissions could aid these conversations.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Agriculture is a significant contributor to anthropogenic global warming, and reducing agricultural emissions—largely methane and nitrous oxide—could play a significant role in climate change mitigation. However, there are important differences between carbon dioxide (CO₂), which is a stock pollutant, and methane (CH₄), which is predominantly a flow pollutant. These dynamics mean that conventional reporting of aggregated CO₂-equivalent emission rates is highly ambiguous and does not straightforwardly reflect historical or anticipated contributions to global temperature change. As a result, the roles and responsibilities of different sectors emitting different gases are similarly obscured by the common means of communicating emission reduction scenarios using CO₂-equivalence. We argue for a shift in how we report agricultural greenhouse gas emissions and think about their mitigation to better reflect the distinct roles of different greenhouse gases. Policy-makers, stakeholders, and society at large should also be reminded that the role of agriculture in climate mitigation is a much broader topic than climate science alone can inform, including considerations of economic and technical feasibility, preferences for food supply and land-use, and notions of fairness and justice. A more nuanced perspective on the impacts of different emissions could aid these conversations.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

We argue that the technological advancements that have driven the growth of microbiome science, including microbiome and untargeted metabolome profiling, can be leveraged to enhance our understanding of safe and efficient HEC. We conclude by presenting our perspective on how we can begin applying these technologies to develop accessible procedures for safe HEC.},

  abstract = {Abstract             This paper explores the important role of critical science, and in particular of post-colonial and decolonial theories, in understanding and shaping the ongoing advances in artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence (AI) is viewed as amongst the technological advances that will reshape modern societies and their relations. While the design and deployment of systems that continually adapt holds the promise of far-reaching positive change, they simultaneously pose significant risks, especially to already vulnerable peoples. Values and power are central to this discussion. Decolonial theories use historical hindsight to explain patterns of power that shape our intellectual, political, economic, and social world. By embedding a decolonial critical approach within its technical practice, AI communities can develop foresight and tactics that can better align research and technology development with established ethical principles, centring vulnerable peoples who continue to bear the brunt of negative impacts of innovation and scientific progress. We highlight problematic applications that are instances of coloniality, and using a decolonial lens, submit three tactics that can form a decolonial field of artificial intelligence: creating a critical technical practice of AI, seeking reverse tutelage and reverse pedagogies, and the renewal of affective and political communities. The years ahead will usher in a wave of new scientific breakthroughs and technologies driven by AI research, making it incumbent upon AI communities to strengthen the social contract through ethical foresight and the multiplicity of intellectual perspectives available to us, ultimately supporting future technologies that enable greater well-being, with the goal of beneficence and justice for all.},

The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility of rearing BSFL on a wide range of low-value waste streams and its potential to transform them into high-quality animal feed and fertilizer. Six waste streams of different origins were selected and each tested in triplicate. Several parameters were analysed: growth performance, waste reduction index (WRI), conversion efficiency (ECI) and larval composition. Frass composition was also analysed. Larvae reared on fast food waste (FFW) had the highest ECI and WRI and the lowest values when reared on pig manure slurry mixed with silage grass (PMLSG) and slaughter waste (SW). The highest protein content was found for larvae reared on mushroom stems (MS) although this substrate had the lowest protein content. Moreover, the frass nutritional profile was proportionally related to the substrate’s nutritional profile: the protein-rich substrate (SW) resulted in protein-rich frass and the low-protein substrate (MS) resulted in protein-poor frass. The same was true for the lipid content. In conclusion, this study showed that BSFL can be successfully reared on a wide range of waste streams that can affect the larval and frass chemical compositions.},

  abstract = {Mealworms and black soldier fly (BSF) larvae are two of the most reared insects at an industrial scale. Both may feed on by-products from agricultural and food industries. Feed efficiency is one of the most important aspects of such processes and varies between species and feed substrates and depends on the metabolic performance of the larvae. Compared to each other, both species may hold advantageous capabilities affecting their feed efficiency, likely depending on the feed substrate. We reared mealworms and BSF larvae on a diverse selection of by-products from agricultural and food industries, quantified major metabolic rates across their life spans, and compared their performances. The type of feed substrates had stronger effects on the growth of mealworms than on black soldier fly larvae. Generally, BSF larvae were advantageous in terms of the highest maximal specific growth rate (0.50–0.77 day−1) and feed assimilation rate (0.81–1.16 day−1) and shortest development period (23–25 days) but disadvantageous in terms of metabolic maintenance cost (0.07–0.21 day−1). In mealworms, the maximal specific growth rates were 0.02–0.11 day−1, the highest feed assimilation rates were 0.16–0.37 day−1, and the development period was at least 65–93 days, while maintenance was only 0.02–0.05 day−1. In contrast to the BSF larvae, the specific maintenance rate was weight dependent in the mealworms and lowest in the largest individuals. The combined outcome of these metabolic rates resulted in an average carbon net growth efficiency, NGE*avg of 0.16–0.40 in mealworms and 0.33–0.56 in BSF larvae across their life span. It thus seems that BSF larvae are more versatile and somewhat more efficient at converting diverse feed substrates into growth than mealworms. Differences in NGE*avg affected the substrate conversion efficiencies (i.e., the ratio of the weight gain of the larvae to the reduced weight of feed substrates) and may thus impact the overall outcome of insect farming.},

  abstract = {Mass production of Hermetia illucens insect larvae is now being adopted in many countries and is taking an industrial production approach. Despite abundant literature on factors that affect larvae growth and the optimal static parameters identified in laboratory setup, for an industrial production process it is necessary to identify the trajectories such that the growth as well as the production process is optimal. To achieve this in this work, some of the important requirements and challenges involved thereof are identified and objectives of the automation process are formulated within a model based optimal control setup. Mechanistic models necessary for the optimization framework are derived as differential equations that describe the dynamic variation of resources (feed, water, O2 etc.), energy, and larval biomass. In addition, the elevated metabolic activity of larvae corresponding to the final instar development is identified and also modelled based on the observation from experiments. The mass and energy balance approach used in modelling enables the quantification and distinction of the mass and energy flux components in various levels (e.g. larvae body, growing medium, production environment, and external environment) while holding its applicability for both open and closed/reactor based production setups. Finally, the trajectories generated using the synthesized optimal controller are tested under different scenarios showcasing significant reduction in resource consumption compared to a constant set-point operation of the production setup. Results presented in this work not only showcase the potential of the mechanistic models and their application in identifying the relevant process parameters (e.g. reactor properties such as volume, thermal conductivity, actuator capacities), but most importantly in optimizing the process dynamically and tuning the process objectives as desired (e.g. maximize larvae mass, reduce energy).},

  abstract = {Abstract             The way governments and policy makers think about climate futures has a wide-ranging impact on how they formulate policy and plan for climate change impacts. In the lead-up to the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6), the IPCC adopted a new scenarios framework that aimed to provide a fuller picture of the interacting elements and policy choices that affect climate change. However, these scenarios, known as Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), are complex and difficult to communicate. Most audiences, including policy makers, receive much of their information about climate change from mainstream media, and particularly online news sites. We therefore examined the five most popular online news sites in the UK and the USA, five popular English-language news sites in India, English-language news media from a wide range of African countries, and the Reuters News agency. Based on manual content analysis to assess 252 articles, we identify several important findings, amongst them: in all countries, the media provide little detailed explanation of how scenarios are developed, very little mention of SSPs, and virtually no detailed explanations of them; generally, journalists use the words ‘projections’, ‘futures’, and ‘pathways’ when talking about the IPCC scenarios, although some usage of ‘predictions’ or ‘forecasts’ is apparent; contrary to previous research, there were very few doomsday narratives such as ‘only 12~years to act’. We conclude by drawing out some implications for more effective communication of the IPCC scenarios.},

The wastes bioconversion by the black soldier fly larva (BSFL) has two potential advantages: the larvae can convert the carbon and nitrogen in the biomass waste, and improve the properties of the substrate to reduce the loss of gaseous carbon and nitrogen. In the present study, the conversion rate of carbon, nitrogen and the emissions of greenhouse gases and NH3 during BSFL bio-treatment of food waste were investigated under different pH conditions. The results showed that the pH of the raw materials is a pivotal parameter affecting the process. The average wet weight of harvested BSFL was 13.26–95.28 mg/larva, with about 1.95–13.41\% and 5.40–18.93\% of recycled carbon and nitrogen from substrate at a pH from 3.0 to 11.0, respectively. Furthermore, pH is adversely correlated with CO2 emissions, but positively with NH3 emissions. Cumulative CO2, NH3, CH4 and N2O emissions at pH ranging from 3.0 to 11.0 were 88.15–161.11 g kg 1, 0.15–1.68 g kg 1, 0.19–2.62 mg kg 1 and 0.02–1.65 mg kg 1, respectively. Compared with the values in open composting, BSFL bio-treatment of food waste could lead greenhouse gas (especially CH4 and N2O) and NH3 emissions to decrease. Therefore, a higher pH value of the substrate can increase the larval output and help the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions.},

  abstract = {Black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) are acknowledged for their potential to upcycle waste biomass into animal feed, human food or biofuels. To ensure sustainable BSFL rearing, insight into nutrient bioconversion efficiencies and nutrient losses via gaseous emissions is key. This study used a mass balance approach to quantify nutrient bioconversion efficiencies (i.e., carbon, energy, nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium) and gaseous emissions (i.e., greenhouse gasses and ammonia) of BSFL reared on a substrate used in industrial production. On this substrate, bioconversion efficiencies ranged from 14\% (potassium) to 38\% (nitrogen). The proportion of dietary inputs found in the residues ranged from 55\% (energy) to 86\% (potassium), while the proportion of dietary inputs lost via gaseous emissions ranged from 1\% (nitrogen) to 24\% (carbon). Direct emissions of methane and nitrous oxide during rearing were 16.8 ± 8.6 g CO2equivalents per kg of dry BSFL biomass. Even though ammonia emissions were minimal, these could have been avoided if larvae would have been harvested before the CO2 peak was reached. Our results provide the first complete mass balance and comprehensive quantification of BSF larval metabolism and GHG emissions, required to assess and improve the environmental sustainability of BSFL production systems. © 2020 The Author(s).

  abstract = {Composting animal manure has the potential to reduce emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) from agriculture. Agriculture has been recognized as a major contributor of greenhouse gases, releasing an estimated 81\% and 70\% of the anthropogenic emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4), respectively. A significant amount of methane is emitted during the storage of liquid manure, whereas nitrous oxide is emitted from the storage of manure and from soil following manure or fertilizer application. Composting animal manure can reduce GHG emissions in two ways; by reducing nitrous oxide and methane emissions during manure storage and application, and by reducing the amount of manufactured fertilizers and the GHG associated with their production and use. We will present information of GHG emissions and potentials for reduction based on available data, and on specific composting experiments. Nitrous oxide and methane emissions were monitored on an enclosed composting system processing liquid hog manure. Measurements indicated that total GHG emissions during composting were 24\% of the Tier 2 IPCC estimates for traditional liquid hog manure management on that farm. Previous research has also indicated little nitrous oxide emission following application of composted manure to soil. The method of composting has a large impact on GHG emissions, where GHG emissions are higher from outdoor windrow composting systems than from controlled aerated systems. Further research is required to assess the whole manure management system, but composting appears to have great potential to reduce GHG emissions from agriculture. The bonus is that composting also addresses a number of other environmental concerns such as pathogens, surface and groundwater quality and ammonia emissions.},

These data were usually recorded in closed static chambers, which did not reflect the actual rearing conditions. On the other hand, open respiration chambers need high amounts of substrate and insects, making the analyses time consuming and expensive. In the present study, a novel small-scale open gas exchange recording system for evaluation of GHG emissions from insects is presented. The device consists of four independent respiration chambers, each one equipped with a pump for supplying air, a flow meter and a septum for sampling the flowing air. A validation experiment was carried out using black soldier fly larvae as model organisms and moistened chicken feed (dry matter 40\%) as rearing substrate. Three independent runs were conducted, each with two replicates, using 200 neonates larvae and 300 g of substrate. Moistened chicken feed (300 g) without larvae was used as control. Throughout the 12 days rearing period, gas sampling occurred every 12 h. Data interpolation considering a linear tendency between two successive sampling points was applied and overall amounts of gases were quantified as area under the curve. Irrespective of the run, CO2 emissions in the insect-substrate systems increased during the initial 7 d of experiment, consistently followed by a rapid decrease. Multiple cross correlation analysis showed high reproducibility (r ≥ 0.9), while significant differences in the CO2 emissions between insects-substrate system (range 7.76–11.88 g g 1 dry insects) and sole substrate (range 0.20–0.33 g g 1 initial dry substrate) were observed. Very limited N2O (≤1.13 mg g 1 dry insects) and CH4 (≤1.33 mg g 1 dry insects) emissions were detected in this experiment, indicating that the performed black soldier fly larvae rearing did not result in significant production of these GHGs. Overall, the experiment showed that the novel device may be particularly suited for quick and reliable estimation of GHG emissions from edible insects.},

Three independent runs were conducted, each with two replicates, using 200 neonates larvae and 300 g of substrate. Moistened chicken feed (300 g) without larvae was used as control. Throughout the 12 days rearing period, gas sampling occurred every 12 h. Data interpolation considering a linear tendency between two successive sampling points was applied and overall amounts of gases were quantified as area under the curve. Irrespective of the run, CO2 emissions in the insect-substrate systems increased during the initial 7 d of experiment, consistently followed by a rapid decrease. Multiple cross correlation analysis showed high reproducibility (r ≥ 0.9), while significant differences in the CO2 emissions between insects-substrate system (range 7.76–11.88 g g 1 dry insects) and sole substrate (range 0.20–0.33 g g 1 initial dry substrate) were observed. Very limited N2O (≤1.13 mg g 1 dry insects) and CH4 (≤1.33 mg g 1 dry insects) emissions were detected in this experiment, indicating that the performed black soldier fly larvae rearing did not result in significant production of these GHGs. Overall, the experiment showed that the novel device may be particularly suited for quick and reliable estimation of GHG emissions from edible insects.},

  abstract = {In this study, the changes in the chemical and biological characteristics of a grape marc vermicompost during a two-year production period were studied to determine the time required for completion of the maturation phase and production of stable vermicompost. Grape marc was added to the surface of a vermireactor monthly for two years. At the end of the experiment, the resulting vermicompost was 100 cm deep and consisted of layers of fresh (top) to processed (bottom) grape marc approximately 15, 30, 180, 360, 540 and 720 days old. Several chemical and biological characteristics were measured in each vermicompost layer at the end of the experiment: the moisture content; pH; electrical conductivity; organic matter content; total and dissolved carbon content; C:N ratio; nutrient content; earthworm density; basal respiration; and the activity of 12 enzymes associated with the carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur cycles. The earthworm density increased 30-fold during the two-year period. In addition, the pH and electrical conductivity as well as the organic matter, total carbon, dissolved organic nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and copper contents all decreased, while the calcium, sulfur, zinc and manganese contents increased. Basal respiration and carboxylesterase, peroxidase and catalase activities were highest during the first 30 days. By contrast, the urease, acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase and arylsulfatase activities were greater after 30 days. The major changes in vermicompost occurred during the initial phase of vermicomposting. However, the chemical and biological characteristics continued to vary during the maturation phase because of microbial activity. Thus, the quality of vermicompost greatly depended on the duration of the maturation (conditioning) phase; therefore, it was difficult to determine the time required to yield a stable product.},

  abstract = {The lack of protein sources in several parts of the world is triggering the search for locally produced and sustainable alternatives. Insect production is recognized as a potential solution. This study is a life cycle assessment (LCA) of food industry side streams transformation via Hermetia illucens into intermediate products applicable for feed and food purposes. It relies on attributional modelling for the estimation of the most impacting stages of insect production and on consequential modelling for the estimation of potential benefits or risks for the agrifood system. The consequential LCA included effects on the market, associated with upstream increase in feed (increase in commercial feed production) or downstream availability of insect product (substitution of fertilizer, protein concentrate for feed or chicken meat). Attributional and consequential LCAs are followed by sensitivity analyses, which identify the most promising directions towards sustainable insect production and estimate the magnitude of impact reductions if those directions are pursued by the industry. Analyses of the existing pilot process largely correspond with other findings in the literature, indicating fresh insect biomass is almost twice more sustainable than fresh chicken meat. Produced at pilot scale, protein concentrate (insect meal) while being competitive against animal-derived (whey, egg protein, fishmeal) and microalgae, has higher environmental impacts than plant-based meals. Further scenarios illustrate strategies for more sustainable use of environmental resources providing guidance for producers and funding agencies to direct the industry to an impact profile that is lower, than many existing protein sources.},

  abstract = {Black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) is an emerging insect-based waste management agent as it provides effective biowaste conversion. Though effective, it requires certain environmental conditions that needs to be monitored regularly to make sure the BSFL can process the waste effectively. But, BSFL farmers are not always on site and the human resource is limited. Thus, remote monitoring system is needed to ease the monitoring process. By using the Internet of Things (IoT) for environmental condition monitoring, data collection from the sensors needs to be obtained in real-time. To do so, a scalable IoT messaging protocol called Message Queuing Telemetry Tracking (MQTT) for the data communiction is implemented. As the data will continuously be sent, a cloud server using Amazon Web Service Elastic Computing 2 (AWS EC2) virtual instance will be used to build the MQTT Broker and to run the data processing program that will processed the data before it is saved to a MySQL database. Using this system, data from the sensors located on the farm is succesfully sent to the MQTT broker, and the saved data in database is showing the same result as the sent data. It was also found that the average delay for data transmission is 0.8125 seconds. Thus, the proposed system has succesfully perform real time data communication using the MQTT protocol for BSFL monitoring system.},

The mean biomethane potential (BMP) of BSFL was 671 mL CH4/g VS, while mean BMP of lipid extracted BSFL (LEBSFL) was 334 mL CH4/g VS. Mean BMP of adult flies and chitinous cuticle were 570 and 343 mL CH4/g VS, respectively. The impact of BSFL diet on bio-methane potential and the biomethane potential of BSFL residue was also investigated.
